    <p>Late getting these notes out so Iâ€™ll be brief! These notes cover 22â€“28 February 2021.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-shuffled-along">Things I shuffled along</h2>

<p>Most of the week was spent in interviews with our partner services, continuing our discovery into payment options, which will help inform GOV.UK Payâ€™s strategy over the next couple of years. Currently the platform only offers one-off card payments and two channels, digital and telephone, but we know that services need more.</p>

<p>No conclusions yet but weâ€™ve been deliberate about exploring the problem space and servicesâ€™ motivations for particular options, trying to learn about the strategic objectives they need to meet as well as the operational objectives.</p>

<p>Personally, itâ€™s helping me place GOV.UK Pay in the strategic landscape, to get an understanding of the market we serve.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-started">Things I started</h2>

<p>Two slide decks, one for our team show &amp; tell and another for GDSâ€™s open show &amp; tell for <a href="https://services.blog.gov.uk/2021/03/01/what-to-expect-during-services-week-2021/">Services Week 2021</a>.</p>

<h2 id="some-puzzles">Some puzzles</h2>

<p>Though I really wanted to create an atmosphere of collaboration, togetherness and figuring stuff out together during this discovery, itâ€™s hard when everything is happening through video calls â€“ and the analysis, the working together, happens a little later.</p>

<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>

<p>Had a lovely catch-up with Rox, our director, last week, and Richard to chat about making product teamsâ€™ work more transparent.</p>

<p>Also lovely to catch up with my mentee, Seun, who is doing so well after getting through coronavirus!</p>

<p>Great to have a sunny weekend in North Wales too ðŸŒž</p>
