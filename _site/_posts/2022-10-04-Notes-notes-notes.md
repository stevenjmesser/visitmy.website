I’ve been meaning to add short notes to this blog for a while. Everything else I write here is a longer post, but it’d be nice to post short little thoughts. It might stop me tweeting so much.

So I created a shortcut that’ll quickly create the front matter for a blog post and paste it into iA Writer. Means I note down little thoughts where ever I am and publish them later.

It’s unlikely I’ll share these notes on the socials. Instead I’ll leave them for RSS massive to find, or anyone who happens to be browsing around.

Thanks to Russell for the [inspiration](https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2022/09/notes-notes.html).
