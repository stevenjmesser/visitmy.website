Redesigning my website has been on my to-do list since mid-2020, but I haven’t got around to doing it yet. It’s not like I haven’t tried.

1. I started adapting the GOV.UK Design System, pulling the unbranded stylesheet into a Jekyll theme.
2. Hand-coding that took too long, so I paid someone on Fiverr to do it for me,
3. Hand-coding a theme was easier once the styles were ported over, but I was ludicrously busy at work.
4. Over Christmas 2021, I had coronavirus and spent the days in bed learning about Tailwind CSS and grid systems.
5. I pulled together a mood board of nice-looking websites using grid systems, inspiring things.
6. This summer I started wireframing a new design in Figma.

This all happened over a 2-year period, but likely less than 1 week of continuous uninterrupted time.

Perhaps what would help is an act of creative destruction. Back in 2021 I [removed the styling from this site]({% post_url 2021-04-09-lets-get-naked %}) for CSS Naked Day. If I did that again, would I be forced to restyle this site? 

Perhaps having a big goal and trying to take chunks out of it is the problem. This quote from Roger’s post on [the coastline paradox](https://irregularideas.substack.com/p/the-coastline-paradox?utm_source=pocket_mylist) is inspiring.
