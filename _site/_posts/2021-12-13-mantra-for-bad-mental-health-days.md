This is definitely one for those people who find safety in being a tiny speck of matter in the vast nothingness of time. So don’t read on if you’re having an existential crisis (just come back after it’s over).

This mantra is an abstraction. As Alan Watts says:

> Abstraction is...a necessity for communication, since it enables us to represent our experiences with simple and rapidly made “grasps” of the mind. 

This mantra is also a haiku. It doesn’t have the usual syllable and line count, but it is the essence of an image in words.

It was written by Jack Kerouac, and it made me smile on a bad mental health day, over a decade ago.
