Blooming good reminder to write notes as you go, from Tom Stuart’s [notes on returning to breadmaking](https://tomstu.art/weeknotes-157-muscle-memory).

> I’d forgotten most of the details of breadmaking so I found myself referring back to old weeknotes to jog my memory. That advice helped — thanks, past me — but was a bit outdated because I’ve since bought a different pan and tweaked the routine.

> It doesn’t seem worth writing this accumulated knowledge down when you’re using it every week like clockwork, but then you stop and it all evaporates. I suppose the lesson here is to make a habit of taking notes as you go, rather than hoping you’ll spot the latest possible moment to record the details right before you forget them.
