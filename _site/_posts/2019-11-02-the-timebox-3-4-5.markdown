We got to the end of the timebox. It was full of ups and downs, we invested ourselves in the work and did our best to act honestly. But we didn't quite meet expectations. 

I'm not going to go into the details because, to be honest, it has been a gruelling, emotionally draining few weeks. Also, we haven't failed: we _have_ learned a lot. 

After hearing a few people talk about trust and failure at [Jam on Thursday]({% post_url 2019-11-02-jam-2019 %}), I've a renewed sense of purpose. I'm really excited to get cracking again. 

This has been one of the toughest times during my product career, but there's nothing quite like it to imbue oneself with first principles. Navigating uncertainty requires empathy for users, trust in your peers, and high-quality information so that you can deliver the requisite experience. 

Onwards!
