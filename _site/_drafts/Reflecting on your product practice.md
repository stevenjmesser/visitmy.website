Among the methods for improving your skills as a product manager - taking a course, reading books and articles, meeting with a mentor, etc. – I’ve found that adopting a reflective practice has been a massive help. Being reflective about my practice meant learning some theory, trying things out, and seeing what worked and what didn’t. What’s good about this method is that I needed few resources, it’s accessible to many, and it’s pretty much self-sufficient.

What I needed was an appetite to try things out, a willingness to learn and grow, time to reflect, and a structured way of developing my skills. However, if the pandemic has made anything clearer, it’s that being able to spend your time however you please is a privilege that not everyone has. I don’t subscribe to hustle culture so I’ll make it clear that I did need 2–3 hours a week to reflect on my practice. 

## Why reflection?
