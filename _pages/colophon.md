Back when I worked in publishing, a colophon was the emblem of the publishing house. It could be used to describe how a publication was made, especially when the book was artfully bound. 

In blogger circles, people are using their colophon page to describe how the words and pages come into being. It’s like a little recipe for how the blog is made.

## Writing

My writing happens through a few methods.

1. Regular-ish journaling
2. Regular-ish reading and note-taking
3. Bursts of inspiration followed by automatic writing

Really I should have more of a process – I did a creative writing degree, forgodssake! – but, honestly, I’ve always enjoyed riding the waves of words as they spill forth inside my head. 

Ruck Rubin says: ‘When we go inside, we are processing what’s going on outside. We’re no longer separate. We’re connected. We are one.’ You can find that oneness from flow or you can find it from ritual. Both work.

So, when I’m being more ritualistic, this means collecting a bunch of things to read from RSS feeds (via [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)) or [other people’s blogs]({{ "/blogroll" | relative_url }}) or links to things, saving them in [Reader](https://readwise.io/read), and then reading what I’ve collected. As I read, I highlight passages and make notes, which feed into [Readwise](https://readwise.io) (and a personal archive in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)). If I’m reading around a certain topic, I’ll usually start writing about it too. But if I’m just reading for reading’s sake, the notes and highlights go into the big brain tombola. We’ll turn that later and see what comes out.

Journalling takes two forms: this year (2025) I started journaling in Obsidian each day, either in the morning or evening, which feed into [my weeknotes]({{ "/tag/weeknotes" | relative_url }}); and even if I haven’t journaled in Obsidian, I try and reflect on work and life once a week, to keep the cogs turning. 

When I’m overloaded or busy or just need to keep quiet, I might not journal or write weeknotes. Most years I have a little break.

In Obsidian, I use [Smart Connections](https://smartconnections.app) to make links between my writing, my notes and the passages I’ve highlighted elsewhere. This helps me make connections and develop more thoughts – or further develop a piece of writing. Sometimes I’ll just scan through Readwise, looking at the highlights from books or articles I’ve made, letting my brain make the connections.

My writing happens in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), either [on my phone when inspiration strikes]({% post_url 2022-10-04-Notes-notes-notes %}) or on my computers. All the notes are in the cloud. iA Writer helps me focus on the sentences before me. Markdown has been a second language of mine for years, and I’m glad more and more tools are supporting it. 

What about editing? 

Well, it’s worth saying that university taught me I’m a better editor than I am a writer...but unhelpfully I suck at editing my own work. Hence the preference for automatic writing. 

Alas, when I read a piece I’ve written and realise it needs some editing, I’ll sleep on it: I’ll put it aside for a few days and come back to it later. This gives me the headspace to approach it anew, with my editing hat on. The rhythm and the patter of the passages matter most, then the structure. Where I need to focus more effort is vocabulary: I’m lazy, re-using words and phrases often.

Time for the big question now. _Why do I write?_ To work things out. To pass things on. To understand. To find delight in phrases. To participate in the human tradition. To become part of that composite Us that brings far richer meaning to the I.
