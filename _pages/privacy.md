This website uses [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/XKBW2Q) cookie-less analytics, a privacy-first product. It’s a great alternative to Google Analytics and I encourage everyone to use it. You can even use it for small projects or quick little prototypes because you don’t have to display cookie notices, simply gather the data you need and move on.

_No cookie notices, you say?_ That’s right! Because it doesn’t collect any personal or personally identifiable data, Fathom Analytics is [GDPR, CCPA and PECR (cookie law) compliant](https://usefathom.com/gdpr-ccpa-pecr-compliant). No pesky notices, no worries about accidentally polluting your analytics with personal information.

Please, stop using Google Analytics. Here’s a [$10 credit for Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/XKBW2Q) which also has a 7-day free trial. Give it a go.
