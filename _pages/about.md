<p>Hello, I’m Steve. I grew up in the Black Country where there used to be lots of factories and lots of smoke, the heart of the Industrial Revolution, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mt80vikTxU" target="_blank">people talk different</a>. Nowadays I live in London.</p>

<p>For the day job, I’m a digital product & design person. My main skill is product management, but I studied Creative Writing at university, which brings creative techniques to my craft.</p>

<p>Right now I’m working on making land and housing data easier to find, use and trust at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/about/" target="_blank">Digital Land team</a>. That's happening through my consultancy, <a href="https://boringmagi.cc/" target="_blank">Boring Magic</a>. I’m also running the <a href="https://productforthepeople.xyz" target="_blank">Product for the People</a> community with Matt Jukes and Debbie Blanchard.</p>

<p>I recently worked at Government Digital Service on the GOV.UK Design System. In 2022 I worked at <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk" target="_blank">NHS Digital</a> on the Data Services team, using the nation’s health data to drive research and transform services. Previously I was Head of Product at <a href="https://claimer.com/" target="_blank">Claimer</a>, a product making it effortless for startups to find and claim £millions in tax credits. Before that, I worked at Government Digital Service (GDS) on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay" target="_blank">GOV.UK Pay</a>, a payments platform, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.gov.uk</a>, the UK government’s website. And earlier than that, I worked at <a href="https://porism.com" target="_blank">Porism</a> on open linked data, data standards and <a href="https://ecasework.com" target="_blank">eCasework</a>, a case management tool for local councillors. There’s more about my work experience in my <a href="{{ "/work" | relative_url }}">portfolio</a>.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about innovation for the public good and open, ethical product design, thinking about how we can make public services more frictionless and better for people. I used to teach product management at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/steve-messer/19440" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll mostly hear me yabbering on about: product management, user-centred design, leading agile teams, design, data, sustainability, food, ancient history, human culture, and the technology-augmented anthropecene. Here’s <a href="{{ "/now" | relative_url }}">what I’m doing now</a>.</p>
