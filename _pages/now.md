<p>Right now I’m
  <ul>
    <li>working on product strategy and leadership at MHCLG (through <a href="https://boringmagi.cc" target="_blank">Boring Magic</a>), making land and housing data easier to find, use and trust</li>
    <li>planning a hiking trip across the Spanish Pyrenees</li>
    <li>reading <i>Travels with a Writing Brush: Classical Japanese Travel Writing from the Manyoshu to Basho</i>, selected and translated by Meredith McKinney</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Later I’d like to
  <ul>
    <li>pick up where I left off learning Welsh</li>
    <li>walk the Llŷn Peninsula section of the Wales Coast Path</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>If I finish the projects in the top list, I’ll have time to take on projects in the bottom list. That, I’m told, is the point of a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>.</p>
