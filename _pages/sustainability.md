When I realised that [my website was killing the planet]({% post_url 2020-07-13-this-website-is-killing-the-planet %}) and pumping out nearly 7g of CO2 with every visit to the homepage, I decided to make a change. Instead of using images as decoration, JavaScript for fancy loading animations and GitHub Pages as a free host, I have

- reduced my use of images and optimised any images I do use
- removed the unnecessary JavaScript
- moved to a web hosting company using renewable energy

There is [a grove of trees planted for this website](https://treesforlife.org.uk/groves/249395/) that will capture carbon from the atmosphere for years to come. Each year Iâ€™ll donate 1 to 2 trees based on how much carbon the website creates.
