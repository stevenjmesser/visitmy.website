Social media is a good first port of call if you want to contact me. I'm using Twitter less these days, but my handle is [@stevenjmesser](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser). It could take me a few days to notice and reply to a message, so try Mastodon instead â€“ I'm [@stevenjmesser@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@stevenjmesser). For the professional touch, try me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenjmesser/).

Still not sure about sharing my email address, although I do have a good spam-filtering system. Maybe I should just share it...
