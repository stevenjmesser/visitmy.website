Social media is a good first port of call if you want to contact me. I'm using Mastodon more these days and my handle is [@stevenjmesser@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@stevenjmesser). You can try me on Bluesky too ([@stevenjmesser.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/stevenjmesser.bsky.social)). For the professional touch, try me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenjmesser/).

You can get me on ste@renegatus.com if you like email. (Since people usually ask, it's an old domain from when I was 13. :facepalm:)

I'm using Twitter less these days, but my handle is [@stevenjmesser](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser). It could take me a few days to notice and reply to a message, so use the above instead.
