    <p>Recently I’ve been setting some professional development objectives, so that I can continue developing skills and adding value to the service I’m working on. And maybe work towards a promotion.</p>

<p>Based on what I’m working on and the context we’re in, I’m thinking it’d be sensible to mix and match skills from two <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework">capability profiles</a>…</p>

<p>For context, I’m working in a service redesign team on an end-to-end service. That means we’re looking at how to iterate the minimum viable service and make it more scalable over time.</p>

<p>I’ve been hired as a senior product manager, but I’m not the only product manager working on the service. That’s because <a href="https://medium.com/@teropsv/products-deliver-outputs-services-deliver-outcomes-845f964ba1ff">a service is everything a user needs to do to achieve a goal</a>, and a service can be made up of products, platforms and enabling services.</p>

<p>So while I don’t tell other product or service managers what to do, I am involved in how their areas knit together. I’m the glue.</p>

<p>I’m sometimes acting a bit more like a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager#lead-product-manager">lead product manager</a> than a senior, providing that glue, because I’m working with our service owner to give teams direction. And sometimes I’m acting like a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/service-designer#senior-service-designer">senior service designer</a> too, advocating for design and how we use it to meet users’ needs.</p>

<p>So right now, I’m not my job title. It’s a bit of product, a bit of design, and some coaching on agile delivery at scale. But if I’m not my job title, how am I supposed to write my professional development objectives?</p>

<p>How the DDaT skills profile describe strategic ownership/thinking for product managers and service designers caught me out.</p>

<p>Strategic ownership for product managers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can develop a long-term vision and objectives. You can take a discerning and disciplined approach to focusing on what is important and most relevant. You can develop the capability of others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strategic thinking for service designers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can lead the design and implementation of strategy, directing the evaluation of strategies and policies to ensure business requirements are being met.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition for service designers is more what I do: designing strategies, ensuring they deliver value and meet requirements. It’s pragmatic. Which is more than developing visions and objectives…although I also do that.</p>

<p>Am I doing two jobs?</p>

<p>I don’t care too much. Pigeonholing people can mean you lose sight of creating valuable outcomes for users. And you ignore the multifaceted experience a person might have. But it’s <a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/why-cant-we-all-just-get-along/">a trend people have observed</a>, focusing on job titles rather than collaboration.</p>

<p>There’s value in sharing methods too. Service design techniques were useful when I was sole product manager at a startup. And though I knew the concept of rapid prototyping, I wouldn’t have been able to design interfaces at the startup well had I not spent so much time with excellent interaction designers.</p>

<p>So let’s be thankful when we’ve got enough specialists on a team to do a job well. But let’s also realise when you have to fill gaps, when you are not your job title.</p>
