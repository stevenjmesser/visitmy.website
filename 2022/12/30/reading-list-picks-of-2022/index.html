    <p>Every year I put together one of these lists, of things I read that gave me ideas, crystallised my thinking or changed my mind. The tally of things I read dropped compared to previous years and I found myself hunting out articles based on need, rather than just working through my list of saved things. So there’s more on product management and digital delivery, fewer diverse topics than previous years.</p>

<h3 id="dont-confuse-these-12-shortcuts-with-iteration">Don’t confuse these 12 shortcuts with iteration</h3>

<p>Over the last 2 years I’ve been using the phrase ‘scope hammer’ a lot, which is when I’m looking to reduce the amount of effort we put in to building something, working down to the irreducible core. That’s because I’ve been working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">0-to-1</a> situations, getting something off the ground, when moving fast helps. These principles on iteration from GitLab are really helpful in not shaving off the wrong kinds of work.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-be-a-trusted-agitator">How to be a trusted agitator</h3>

<p>When you become more senior in your role, you start interacting with the management and leadership layers of an organisation more. The way I work is like an agitator, or a catalyst, and the tactics that worked in teams don’t always suit the leaders. So I’m working on how to be a more trusted character. This piece from Laura Yarrow is a corker.</p>

<h3 id="on-principles">On Principles</h3>

<p>I’ve long thought that a good set of principles can carry you very far. Principles inspire action, help you make decisions, set boundaries and guide you. When I was head of product at a startup, I wrote a set of principles for the team, which were referred to often. James Boardwell has written about how he created some principles on a team at Ministry of Justice.</p>

<h3 id="products-deliver-outputs-services-deliver-outcomes">Products deliver outputs, services deliver outcomes</h3>

<p>If you orient your work around meeting users’ needs and improving their experience, the semantic debate over what is a service and what is a product feels like a moot point. A product mindset and the tenets of user-centred service design are the same. But for organisations going through digital transformation and not fully understanding all the lingo, definitions can help. This definition from Tero Väänänen is really useful, and the diagram helped me explain our service to technology-minded stakeholders at NHS Digital. (I also like the idea of platforms as enabling services.)</p>

<h3 id="why-figma-is-selling-to-adobe-for-20-billion">Why Figma is selling to Adobe for $20 billion</h3>

<p>This is a great, in-depth interview with Figma’s CEO. Their sale to Adobe is almost beside the point, or at least it doesn’t seem to be the focus of Dylan Field. He cares more about building a product to meet its vision and enabling an organisation around that. If you’re interested in product strategy, jobs-to-be-done as a lens for growth, and web standards at the heart of a product, I reckon you’ll get a kick out of this.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-know-about-time-pressure-in-software-development">What Do We Know About Time Pressure in Software Development?</h3>

<p>Some times you’ll need to work to a strict deadline when shipping software. Launching an MVP, for example, or meeting a regulatory change. The problem with deadline-driven development is that it makes people think that deadlines are a good thing, that you’ll always ship great software when working under time pressure. This literature review shows how though time pressure <em>can</em> be useful, it is negative in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="shipping-great-work">Shipping Great Work</h3>

<p>Being the first product manager at a startup basically means you’re the delivery manager too. Although I think I’ve got a really good grasp of the role and how to deliver software, there’s an added pressure when you’re doing all the product thinking, the design <em>and</em> you’re looking after delivery. This was a great resource covering many of the activities that go in to shipping great software beyond adopting something like Scrum or Kanban.</p>

<h3 id="how-big-tech-runs-tech-projects-and-the-curious-absence-of-scrum">How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum</h3>

<p>Most teams I’ve worked on have used Scrum or Scrumban, and though it was all the rage over a decade ago, times have changed. At the startup I had the opportunity to weigh up different approaches, and this piece provided a really useful input, helping me see how other teams ship good software quickly. (Hot take: I think that mature digital teams in the public sector should drop Scrum.)</p>

<h3 id="how-to-disappoint-people">How to disappoint people</h3>

<p>The idea that ‘every project starts with a fixed amount of disappointment’ was a real mind-blown moment for me. Too often I’ve kidded myself into thinking we’ll pull it off. This is a more realistic framing, one that works particularly well on teams with low strategic autonomy. If you’re handed some ideas to build or very specific goals to reach, this set of posts from Neil Vass will likely be helpful. (The links go to the Web Archive as Neil’s site seems to be broken at the moment.)</p>

<h3 id="lowercase-magic">lowercase magic</h3>

<p>This popped up in my RSS feed after I’d started experimenting with writing in lowercase on Twitter. It probably goes way overboard on the power of dropping conformity and perfection, but it was good to see how unshackling oneself had helped someone else.</p>

<p>Although I thought a lot of creating serendipity in 2020 and 2021, when I was working fully remote, I hadn’t thought much about it this year. Then Matt Webb comes out with this post about creating ‘water-cooler moments’ online, using the Prohibition as inspiration. Something to share with anyone thinking about hybrid working culture.</p>

<h3 id="complex-personhood">Complex Personhood</h3>

<p>This is all about how people’s lives aren’t as straightforward as they think. It’s about the culture wars, although it’s really about how that’s too simple a definition. What I took from it is that no matter how much you (or another person) try to define yourself, your personhood, things are much more complicated.</p>

<h3 id="the-old-internet">The old internet</h3>

<p>Oddly found this a couple of weeks before everyone started migrating from Twitter over to Mastodon. It talks about the old internet, how centralised services weren’t the norm, and is a call for people to create their own websites.</p>

<p>This piece from the Co-op Digital blog, written by the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyMcNichol">Amy McNichol</a>, sums up 7 years of working in the open at the organisation. Most blog posts (including my own) give point-in-time reasonings for talking about your work, but this one condenses a long stint in the game.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of my RSS feed has been any new post from Russell, and this one is exciting. He’s going to be writing a book about sharing ideas in public, and points to some other people who do the same. (Might this inspire you to do the same?)</p>

<h3 id="wealth-is-the-missing-piece">Wealth is the Missing Piece</h3>

<p>This is a North American piece about how wealth affords privilege to different groups. It’s interesting because it’s ostensibly about class, which isn’t something Americans really talk about, but it breaks it down very well.</p>

<h3 id="fleeing-twitter">Fleeing Twitter</h3>

<p>This article discusses the implications of Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter and the potential increase in trolling and hate speech on the platform. It draws attention to the fact that the majority of people leaving or threatening to leave the platform are white liberals, contrasting with the fact that it will be disproportionately not white people who will bear the brunt of the toxicity.</p>

<p>More excellent data journalism from John Burn-Murdoch. Reminds me of seeing a chart tracking the bank base rate over several decades in the UK and its impact on GDP. Memories of A-level macroeconomics. There is a distinct difference between the economic policies of the two main parties and its impact on our country.</p>

<p>I find Dominic Cummings a fascinating character, so this rare interview is a chance to look inside his brain a bit. This came out before all the Conservative party turmoil in the summer, and he does point to Truss potentially getting in because Rishi had ruined himself. Not saying he can predict world events, but his concept of politics being totally ruined might not be far from the truth.</p>

That’s because I’ve been working in 0-to-1 situations, getting something off the ground, when moving fast helps. These principles on iteration from GitLab are really helpful in not shaving off the wrong kinds of work.\n\nRead Don’t confuse these 12 shortcuts with iteration, 6 mins\n\nHow to be a trusted agitator\n\nWhen you become more senior in your role, you start interacting with the management and leadership layers of an organisation more. The way I work is like an agitator, or a catalyst, and the tactics that worked in teams don’t always suit the leaders. So I’m working on how to be a more trusted character. This piece from Laura Yarrow is a corker.\n\nRead How to be a trusted agitator, 4 mins\n\nOn Principles\n\nI’ve long thought that a good set of principles can carry you very far. Principles inspire action, help you make decisions, set boundaries and guide you. When I was head of product at a startup, I wrote a set of principles for the team, which were referred to often. James Boardwell has written about how he created some principles on a team at Ministry of Justice.\n\nRead On Principles, 3 mins\n\nProducts deliver outputs, services deliver outcomes\n\nIf you orient your work around meeting users’ needs and improving their experience, the semantic debate over what is a service and what is a product feels like a moot point. A product mindset and the tenets of user-centred service design are the same. But for organisations going through digital transformation and not fully understanding all the lingo, definitions can help. This definition from Tero Väänänen is really useful, and the diagram helped me explain our service to technology-minded stakeholders at NHS Digital. (I also like the idea of platforms as enabling services.)\n\nRead Products deliver outputs, services deliver outcomes, 7 mins\n\n10 good design reads that aren’t written by white men\n\nDoes what it says on the tin.\n\nRead 10 good design reads that aren’t written by white men, 10 mins\n\nList of inclusive design books\n\nA similar list from Benjy Stanton that’s all about doing design inclusively.\n\nRead List of inclusive design books, 2 mins\n\nWhy Figma is selling to Adobe for $20 billion\n\nThis is a great, in-depth interview with Figma’s CEO. Their sale to Adobe is almost beside the point, or at least it doesn’t seem to be the focus of Dylan Field. He cares more about building a product to meet its vision and enabling an organisation around that. If you’re interested in product strategy, jobs-to-be-done as a lens for growth, and web standards at the heart of a product, I reckon you’ll get a kick out of this.\n\nRead Why Figma is selling to Adobe for $20 billion, 53 mins\n\nDigital teams\n\nWhat Do We Know About Time Pressure in Software Development?\n\nSome times you’ll need to work to a strict deadline when shipping software. Launching an MVP, for example, or meeting a regulatory change. The problem with deadline-driven development is that it makes people think that deadlines are a good thing, that you’ll always ship great software when working under time pressure. This literature review shows how though time pressure can be useful, it is negative in the long run.\n\nRead What Do We Know About Time Pressure in Software Development?, 10 mins\n\nShipping Great Work\n\nBeing the first product manager at a startup basically means you’re the delivery manager too. Although I think I’ve got a really good grasp of the role and how to deliver software, there’s an added pressure when you’re doing all the product thinking, the design and you’re looking after delivery. This was a great resource covering many of the activities that go in to shipping great software beyond adopting something like Scrum or Kanban.\n\nRead Shipping Great Work, 30 mins\n\nHow Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum\n\nMost teams I’ve worked on have used Scrum or Scrumban, and though it was all the rage over a decade ago, times have changed. At the startup I had the opportunity to weigh up different approaches, and this piece provided a really useful input, helping me see how other teams ship good software quickly. (Hot take: I think that mature digital teams in the public sector should drop Scrum.)\n\nRead How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum, 23 mins\n\nHow to disappoint people\n\nThe idea that ‘every project starts with a fixed amount of disappointment’ was a real mind-blown moment for me. Too often I’ve kidded myself into thinking we’ll pull it off. This is a more realistic framing, one that works particularly well on teams with low strategic autonomy. If you’re handed some ideas to build or very specific goals to reach, this set of posts from Neil Vass will likely be helpful. (The links go to the Web Archive as Neil’s site seems to be broken at the moment.)\n\nRead part 1 (5 mins), part 2 (6 mins) and part 3 (11 mins)\n\nLevelling Up When You Can’t Get Headcount\n\nStartups and the British public sector faced similar problems this year: a reduction in the number of people they could hire. This post has some good tips on how to make progress when you’re in a hiring freeze.\n\nRead Levelling Up When You Can’t Get Headcount, 3 mins\n\nInternet ways of being\n\nlowercase magic\n\nThis popped up in my RSS feed after I’d started experimenting with writing in lowercase on Twitter. It probably goes way overboard on the power of dropping conformity and perfection, but it was good to see how unshackling oneself had helped someone else.\n\nRead lowercase magic, 9 mins\n\nWorkplace serendipity, invention, and lessons from Prohibition 1920-1933\n\nAlthough I thought a lot of creating serendipity in 2020 and 2021, when I was working fully remote, I hadn’t thought much about it this year. Then Matt Webb comes out with this post about creating ‘water-cooler moments’ online, using the Prohibition as inspiration. Something to share with anyone thinking about hybrid working culture.\n\nRead Workplace serendipity, invention, and lessons from Prohibition 1920-1933, 3 mins\n\nComplex Personhood\n\nThis is all about how people’s lives aren’t as straightforward as they think. It’s about the culture wars, although it’s really about how that’s too simple a definition. What I took from it is that no matter how much you (or another person) try to define yourself, your personhood, things are much more complicated.\n\nRead Complex Personhood, 3 mins\n\nThe old internet\n\nOddly found this a couple of weeks before everyone started migrating from Twitter over to Mastodon. It talks about the old internet, how centralised services weren’t the norm, and is a call for people to create their own websites.\n\nRead The old internet, 2 mins\n\nWorking in the open\n\nGenerating Agency Through Blogging\n\nA good piece on how blogging regularly can help you find better career prospects through networking, and generally have more agency in the work you do. Something I wholeheartedly support!\n\nRead Generating Agency Through Blogging, 4 mins\n\nWhy we should work in the open\n\nThis piece from the Co-op Digital blog, written by the excellent Amy McNichol, sums up 7 years of working in the open at the organisation. Most blog posts (including my own) give point-in-time reasonings for talking about your work, but this one condenses a long stint in the game.\n\nRead Why we should work in the open, 6 mins\n\nZombie Christmas\n\nOne of the highlights of my RSS feed has been any new post from Russell, and this one is exciting. He’s going to be writing a book about sharing ideas in public, and points to some other people who do the same. (Might this inspire you to do the same?)\n\nRead Zombie Christmas, 2 mins\n\nDivided Kingdom\n\nWealth is the Missing Piece\n\nThis is a North American piece about how wealth affords privilege to different groups. It’s interesting because it’s ostensibly about class, which isn’t something Americans really talk about, but it breaks it down very well.\n\nRead Wealth is the Missing Piece, 22 mins\n\nYoung People Are Lonelier Than Ever\n\nAlarming statistics from across the UK that young people are lacking human connection. Contains good links to services that can help you meet new people.\n\nRead Young People Are Lonelier Than Ever, 7 mins\n\nFleeing Twitter\n\nThis article discusses the implications of Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter and the potential increase in trolling and hate speech on the platform. It draws attention to the fact that the majority of people leaving or threatening to leave the platform are white liberals, contrasting with the fact that it will be disproportionately not white people who will bear the brunt of the toxicity.\n\nRead Fleeing Twitter, 6 mins\n\nBritain’s winter of discontent is the inevitable result of austerity\n\nMore excellent data journalism from John Burn-Murdoch. Reminds me of seeing a chart tracking the bank base rate over several decades in the UK and its impact on GDP. Memories of A-level macroeconomics. There is a distinct difference between the economic policies of the two main parties and its impact on our country.\n\nRead Britain’s winter of discontent is the inevitable result of austerity (no paywall), 4 mins\n\nJust good pieces\n\nDominic Cummings: “I don’t like parties”\n\nI find Dominic Cummings a fascinating character, so this rare interview is a chance to look inside his brain a bit. This came out before all the Conservative party turmoil in the summer, and he does point to Truss potentially getting in because Rishi had ruined himself. Not saying he can predict world events, but his concept of politics being totally ruined might not be far from the truth.\n\nRead Dominic Cummings: “I don’t like parties”, 20 mins\n\nInside the Pain Cave\n\nHow to visualise discomfort and pain to work through it, while running or doing something else. This is an interview with Courtney Dauwalter, who’s a cool ultra-runner who pretty much came out of nowhere. Overnight ordinary superhero.\n\nRead Inside the Pain Cave, 18 mins\n\n(Tele)pathy\n\nThe little essays that Boot Boyz write to go with their new garms are great, they always teach me something or land me upon a new source. Super interesting reading. This one fired off all sorts of thoughts about Zen which I wrote about.\n\nRead (Tele)pathy, 13 mins\n\nDear male ego\n\nAmy Hupe’s a fantastic writer and I hope she’ll start writing about other topics, because this piece about perceiving the male ego as a woman, and its impact, was pretty powerful.\n\nRead Dear male ego, 5 mins\n\nCould Consciousness Be a Memory System? New Theory Says Yes\n\nEverything we perceive could actually be a memory. Mind-blowing new theory.\n\nRead Could Consciousness Be a Memory System? New Theory Says Yes, 6 mins\n\n\n\nCheck out my reading lists from 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n",
