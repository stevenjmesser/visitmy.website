    <p>I write weeknotes to record what I’ve done, and to reflect on my practice as a product manager. I’ve used a couple of formats over the years, but the headings in my weeknotes template don’t provoke reflection.</p>

<p>Though I do reflect by actively remembering and writing down what I did, I want to be more intentional with my weeknotes. A new set of questions should act as prompts, encouraging me to reflect on how my actions align with my values, or help me move towards the place I want to be spiritually.</p>

<h2 id="personal-values">Personal values</h2>

<p>After working at a startup and feeling like I wasn’t in the right place, that I wasn’t able to do work that fulfilled me, I made a move back to the public sector. At the time I told myself that working in public service aligns more closely with my personal values…but, to be honest, I didn’t <em>really</em> know what those were.</p>

<p>Sure, I knew that I wanted to do things for people, not profit. And I knew that workplaces with good psychological safety energised me. But I couldn’t easily nail down my values. So I turned elsewhere for some help.</p>

<p>I read a few scholarly articles on personal values and there’s a popular framework developed by Shalom H. Schwartz that’s widely referenced. I found an online test that used the framework and answered its questions, to try and work out what my values might be.</p>

<p>My strongest felt values were</p>

<ul>
  <li>hedonism</li>
  <li>universalism</li>
  <li>self-direction, and</li>
  <li>benevolence</li>
</ul>

<p>Hedonism is about pleasure, enjoyment and having fun. Universalism is all about doing things for the benefit of other humans and nature. Self-direction is about creativity, freedom and choosing your own goals. Benevolence is about increasing the welfare of those around you.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up-with-the-questions">Coming up with the questions</h2>

<p>I’ve written and edited a set of questions which, I hope, will help me reflect on whether I’m living my values. I’ve also included questions to help me think about how I’m finding balance, inspired by reading Becky Hall’s <em>The Art of Enough</em>.</p>

<p>If there’s no answer to one of these questions, it’s time to ask whether there was an opportunity to live that value in the week. Though I believe in growth, I also believe in limits and boundaries: you can’t push yourself endlessly, and we’re all subject to the chaos of the world.</p>

<p>‘To the mind which lets go and moves with the flow of change, emptiness becomes a kind of ecstasy.’ This comes from Zen Buddhism, another influence on my thinking and doing in the last two years. In <em>The Way of Zen</em>, Alan Watts talks about relying on ‘peripheral vision’ or intuition, so I added a question about that too.</p>

<h2 id="my-weekly-prompts">My weekly prompts</h2>

<p>The questions I’ve settled on as my weekly prompts are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What did I do for the people and planet?</li>
  <li>What did I appreciate? What was fun or made me happy?</li>
  <li>What did I do for those around me?</li>
  <li>What did I do for my well-being? What was ‘just enough’?</li>
  <li>What happened through play or intuition?</li>
  <li>What was hard or puzzling?</li>
  <li>What did I learn?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions will help me structure my reflections, pull the stories out of the work I did in the week, but they shouldn’t appear as headings in published weeknotes. I tried the headings in <a href="/2023/01/06/the-chocolate-cake/">S13E18</a> but the weeknotes didn’t feel right, something I reflected on in <a href="/2023/01/15/the-unconference-2/">S14E01</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll continue experimenting with these prompts and tweak things where needed.</p>
