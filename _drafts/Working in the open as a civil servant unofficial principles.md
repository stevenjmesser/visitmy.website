I've written before about [blogging and working in the open]({% post_url 2020-01-25-blogging-working-open %}) and why we should do the hard work to make things simpler for those who come after us. Opening up government might be considered hard for a couple of reasons:

1. After a long day at the coal-face, the last thing on your mind is writing about it all.
2. As a civil servant it's not clear what you can and can't talk about.

That last point is the big one: people are worried about getting in trouble. 

Back in [May]({% post_url 2020-05-03-the-isolation-4 %}), [Alex](https://twitter.com/pr0bablyfine) and I met with the Head of Communications & Engagement to chat about weeknotes. They had intimated that you couldn't blog about work on personal channels and we wanted to challenge that. But that wasn't what they meant, it turns out, so we chatted about blogging as a civil servant and the boundaries needed. They’re supportive of people writing about work provided they follow the Civil Service Code and don’t use personal channels as government outlets. Which is fair enough really. 

But what does that mean?

## Unofficial principles

1. The [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) underpins everything. Stick by that. Don't say the Government is shit or a policy is damaging. You can have opinions but you don't need to air them in a public forum.
2. Government hates surprises, so check that something is in the public domain before referring to it. If it isn't, neuter what you say so that you're not making a Minister's announcement for them. Then go back to your team and start writing an official blog post about it.
3. If in doubt, don't post it. Ask someone else whether it's OK to share. It'll help build your sense of what's OK and what's not.
4. Check what others have been in trouble for. There's always some MP or councillor or advisor in the press about something they shouldn't have said. They make for a good yardstick.

_**Disclaimer:** These are my own unofficial principles based on my experience of working in the open. Read the Cabinet Office's [social media guidance for civil servants](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants/social-media-guidance-for-civil-servants) for the official word._

All in all, that's why I like personal weeknotes as a format. They're less about communicating what government is doing, more about how **you** are working, what's working and what's not. More of a journal of your personal skills and development rather than anything else.
