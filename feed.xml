        <title>The Sense-making</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These are coming out on a Monday because I was too wiped from work at the weekend. It’s good to go into overdrive every now and then, to squeeze out those thoughts that really need you to spend the extra brain credits, but it’s not sustainable. There’s a bit more headroom now I’m not teaching in the evenings though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week in the payment options discovery, we started to wrap up our findings on organisations’ needs for procuring, implementing and managing different payment options, as well as continue to develop our understand of the specific pain points with telephone payments and recurring payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up our findings, we&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;interviewed some teams that don’t use Pay, to help validate what others told us&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pulled out the qualities that distinguish different organisations and their approach to payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last bit is really useful. It gives us a picture of the kinds of teams we’re dealing with, their unique behaviours and the strategic objectives or blockers they have. It’s good for digging in to the ‘why’ behind their answers, to help us understand why they’ve implemented certain payment options in the past. So now we know that when one team comes and asks for Direct Debit, it doesn’t mean the same as when another team asks for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue developing our understanding of specific pain points, we&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drew up service blueprints for telephone payments and recurring payments based on what we know so far&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;highlighted areas we were unsure about or had questions for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wrote up the questions and identified teams to answer them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;circled which areas are likely to need the most detailed tech and design work to understand further&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started preparing the slide deck for the discovery playback on 1 April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled together a crude benefits model too. Though providing telephone payments and recurring payments through Pay is likely to create some cashable benefits for services, it can also be a blocker to them cashing in the other benefits of taking payments online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main theme emerging for me is how much Government-as-a-Platform has been designed primarily for central government but local authorities with the right approach can benefit from our platforms too. Only there hasn’t been the same mandate for digital transformation in local government, so the responsibility falls on digital teams and departments that drank the Kool-Aid to convince the rest of the council. That’s hefty political work, let alone all the day-to-day change management. Props to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A presentation for a third and final interview that happened on Friday. They seemed to really like it, so I’m waiting to hear back how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were talking about how we might use office space when we go back to one. A thing we don’t want to happen is for anyone working remotely to become a second-class citizen to those working in close proximity: it’s really easy to turn and tap someone on the shoulder, forgetting to pull in your colleagues working from home. Another problem is background noise and its effect on video meetings (because there’s likely to be many of those).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrote up some experiments we’d like to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See if a telepresence setup can equalise the friction of having ad-hoc conversations (‘tap someone on the shoulder’ but through video)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment with equipment, rooms and furniture to find the cheapest way to allow every individual in the office to dial in to a meeting without disturbing those around them – but that probably needs other teams to be present, and the experiment needs to happen in the offices we will use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See if a big touch screen running Mural and some specific facilitation rules can result in a remote/office hybrid meeting that is equal for all participants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment with AV equipment to allow good sound quality of stand-up meetings outside meeting rooms (needs background noise)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For high-level strategy meetings (long, draining over video) and line management catch-ups (human element is beneficial), compare the effectiveness of co-location vs fully remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve updated &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/02/free-range-future-of-work/&quot;&gt;my post on hybrid working&lt;/a&gt; with what we’ve learned over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched a few films and started playing &lt;em&gt;S.TA.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; in the moments I wasn’t sleeping. It was a week of working late and a weekend of taking it very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the cat got into the loft of Wednesday. A novel problem to solve, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to rest my legs from running as they’re a bit tight, but I’ll get back on the intervals after Easter probably.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Deeper Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s 6 a.m. on a Wednesday and I should have written these last weekend, but never mind, now’s a time as good as any for some reflection. This is &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/01/why-i-write-weeknotes/&quot;&gt;why I write weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week in the payment options discovery, we took another deep dive into our research with 16 services and organisations using GOV.UK Pay, this time looking specifically at service’s needs when they mention telephone payments or recurring payments (usually via Direct Debit). We’re doing that because even though services ask for telephone payments or Direct Debit or other payment options from us, they all apply those solutions in a different way. Our job is to find the common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;read through our transcribed interviews again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pulled out quotes and observations that were specific to telephone payments and recurring payments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;highlighted the pain points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wrote some high-level user needs and behaviours for these things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wrote some acceptance criteria for these behaviours, e.g. it’s done when I can, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;identified the opportunities for us to meet their needs and solve pain points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really proud of the team for getting this far, it’s quite a lot to fit into one discovery and hard to do when remote. Our blueprints for these kinds of activities are office-based and face-to-face, but we managed to do it all with a Mural board, a couple of breaks and several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that work over the week was so draining, I did a bad job on Friday of making a start on our discovery report. Or, rather, I noticed that some of the product &amp;amp; delivery discovery objectives had been put on the back-burner while I focused on facilitating the team. Which meant I panicked a little and reverted to clearing emails and all the other crud that builds up while your head is deep in a problem space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s also why I didn’t write weeknotes last weekend, I was just too tired from the work. A chat with Student Loans Company did buoy me a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on Monday, I woke up knowing what I needed to do to progress those product &amp;amp; delivery objectives. Should I have known this on Friday? Possibly. But also maybe it’s OK that I don’t. I took time to step away from the work over the weekend, which gave my brain more time for sense-making. And that’s a hugely important part of knowledge work. As Rachel says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;workshop isn’t the output.
interview isn’t the output.
hours of processing &amp;amp; sensemaking -hopefully- there’s output&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we’re getting close to our discovery deadline with lower fidelity findings that we’d hoped, but if I’m honest I think Nick was right in saying we were trying to cram too much into a discovery (two discoveries really: what’s the demand for things and what are the pain points with these things). But as long as we’ve learned something and now where we need to dive a little deeper, I think that’s OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly we know where to invest some further effort, the scope of that, and the hurdles we might encounter trying to make those things live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also started pulling together a 10-year roadmap of trends in the payments landscape because a stakeholder needed a high level view of our strategy to discuss with an external stakeholder. It blind-sided me in a week of diving deep into some detail, so it contributed to the brain-scrambling I mentioned above, but that’s OK: I kinda think we should have one of these and revisit it often anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also iterated the induction Trello board for new product managers at GDS. It needed a tidy and a refresh because it had been left untouched for nearly a year. Also a recent recruit, Tim, had spotted some problems with it and been thrown too many boards to handle. I need to go back to the other PMs and ask if we might add the labels from &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/09/06/things-to-do-as-a-new-product-manager/&quot;&gt;my iteration of the board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product community and its future is still a puzzle, but we were grateful to hear from the team putting together a community support model. They’ve done a great job so far and were really open in taking on feedback, asking us to prioritise the most important parts of the model and where support was needed most. Shout-out to Isabella, Laura and Claire – and thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tried out some interval training to improve my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max&quot;&gt;aerobic capacity&lt;/a&gt;, which will hopefully mean I can run faster for longer periods. This meant I ran as fast as possible for 400 metres then took a 1-minute walking break, and I did that 12 times in one session. My average pace was 4:06/km (excluding walk breaks) and my fastest 5km pace so far has been 4:29/km, which is quite a gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rugby was exhilarating on Sunday. Cymru am byth!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week in the payment options discovery, we analysed our research with 16 services and organisations using GOV.UK Pay. That means we&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pulled quotes and observations out of our transcribed interviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grouped these by common high-level themes (e.g. cost, contracts, payment types, user needs, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wrote and developed more specific themes for those categories (e.g. transactions fees are important, technical teams involved / not involved in procurement, pays invoices in instalments, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mapped those to the journey we think teams take when procuring and implementing a payments solution, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/&quot;&gt;What? So what? Now what? structure&lt;/a&gt; to talk about our reckons and what we’ll do next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really cerebral work. You have to take what someone’s told you, pull some meaning out of it, and then weigh that up with all the other bits of information. There’s lots of going deep to understand nuance, then zooming out to do pattern-matching, then going in again to check your assumptions, taking distinct and atomised findings from multiple sources to build a full picture. Like navigating a deep, dark cave with a primitive LIDAR scanner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, though, we ended the week with some great insights and ideas on where to explore next, and we’ve edged closer to deciding which payment options to provide next. We’ve also picked up heaps of useful information that’ll feed into Pay’s wider strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we’ve learned another reason for why the Direct Debit pilot failed: no one wants one-off Direct Debits, they’re mainly useful for simple renewals or paying off debt in instalments. Not having that functionality meant the pilot wasn’t viable. (And we couldn’t have done this without the help of the other discovery team looking into finance processes and enterprise resource planning – thank you, Stroop!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most important is how we ended the week as a team: on a high with a clear idea for what to do next. That synchronicity I was talking about last week has developed over the last week and everyone seems comfortable with each other, with saying what they think without fear of looking silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also launched the MVP for telephone payment links, a new product for taking payments over the phone without needing to integrate with our API. It’s in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works&quot;&gt;private beta phase&lt;/a&gt; with one large department, a town council and a police force.  We’ll collect feedback over the next few weeks to identify and prioritise further iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started pulling together a list of teams to talk to that don’t use GOV.UK Pay, to help us validate what we’ve found so far in the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to a puzzle from a previous weeknote about the product community, this week I spent 2 hours talking to other product people in government. A head of product and a senior product manager looking for advice on KPIs; a product manager moving from the private sector; and a project manager looking to adopt product-thinking. There isn’t a head of the product management community at the moment, and I know these people are only coming to me because I’m a loud-mouth blabber who puts themselves out there, but it does have me worried about who else isn’t getting the support they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on my running form and pace, and I achieved two new personal bests: 22 mins 26 secs for a 5K, and 49 mins 22 secs for a 10K. It’s good progress, but I need to do some sums to see if I’ll hit my goals by the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite fun having an arbitrary goal to progress towards. That’s the post-neolithic human condition really. We’ve sorted out shelter, we’ve sorted out food, we’ve organised ourselves and got some good-enough technology. Now, what arbitrary goal can we reach next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve taken to watching period dramas on Sunday evenings by candlelight, so that the flames light up the lounge as the skies are dimming. It’s very atmospheric. It made &lt;em&gt;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&lt;/em&gt; much more evocative.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Interviews 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the week was spent in interviews with our partner services, continuing our discovery into payment options, which will help inform GOV.UK Pay’s strategy over the next couple of years. Currently the platform only offers one-off card payments and two channels, digital and telephone, but we know that services need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we’re being deliberate about exploring the problem space and services’ motivations for particular options – trying to learn about the strategic objectives they need to meet as well as the operational objectives – we feel that we’re still expected to end this discovery by saying what we’ll build next. I think that risks us not having a real conversation around value, what the public sector needs at large, and how we organise ourselves around providing that over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure we will plonk an option on our roadmap at the end of the discovery and move straight into an alpha, but it’s important that we say, clearly, why we’re choosing not to build the other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s good synchronicity of thought in the discovery team at the moment. Kind of like being on an acid trip with friends, when everyone in the group is sharing each other’s thinking. It’s probably the ideal to aim for in a discovery, although I’m not sure how we’d replicate it in future. A bit of instinct, a bit of luck, and a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doctrine.wardleymaps.com&quot;&gt;doctrine&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m glad there’s more togetherness this week after last week’s puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented at the GDS open show &amp;amp; tell as part of Services Week 2021, so I’ll share the video once it’s uploaded. I spent most of the week in that slide deck either side of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two more slide decks! One for the Smarter Working group on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/&quot;&gt;our experiment with asynchronous communication&lt;/a&gt; and another for &lt;a href=&quot;https://defrafarming.blog.gov.uk&quot;&gt;DEFRA’s Future Farming programme&lt;/a&gt; on platform product management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to change people’s perceptions on product managers. PMs don’t exist to define your work for you and hand it over. It’s more about facilitating the team to do that, giving nudges where needed. I think? I dunno. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was grateful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dgheath21&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; for talking us through technical research into the solutions available to us, it was good to have his help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thommeread&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;, our new CEO, came to chat to me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-downer-21a67594/&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; about the Social Mobility Network, founded by Paul in 2019. We spoke about what the network and its objectives meant to us, and Tom shared openly his interests too, and Paul presented the work that he’s been leading on over the last couple of years. It was good to make those connections, foundations we can build on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A massive thank-you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JuliaFromIT&quot;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Product on GaaP, for presenting the story of her career to some A-level students. There was some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mayorsfund/status/1367430667982819328&quot;&gt;excellent feedback&lt;/a&gt; from the students, and hers is a really inspiring story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Interviews</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Late getting these notes out so I’ll be brief! These notes cover 22–28 February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the week was spent in interviews with our partner services, continuing our discovery into payment options, which will help inform GOV.UK Pay’s strategy over the next couple of years. Currently the platform only offers one-off card payments and two channels, digital and telephone, but we know that services need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No conclusions yet but we’ve been deliberate about exploring the problem space and services’ motivations for particular options, trying to learn about the strategic objectives they need to meet as well as the operational objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, it’s helping me place GOV.UK Pay in the strategic landscape, to get an understanding of the market we serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two slide decks, one for our team show &amp;amp; tell and another for GDS’s open show &amp;amp; tell for &lt;a href=&quot;https://services.blog.gov.uk/2021/03/01/what-to-expect-during-services-week-2021/&quot;&gt;Services Week 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I really wanted to create an atmosphere of collaboration, togetherness and figuring stuff out together during this discovery, it’s hard when everything is happening through video calls – and the analysis, the working together, happens a little later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a lovely catch-up with Rox, our director, last week, and Richard to chat about making product teams’ work more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also lovely to catch up with my mentee, Seun, who is doing so well after getting through coronavirus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great to have a sunny weekend in North Wales too 🌞&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Liminal Space Again</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the week was spent continuing our discovery into new payment types and channels, which will help inform GOV.UK Pay’s strategy over the next couple of years. Currently the platform only offers one-off card payments and two channels, digital and telephone, but we know that services need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the week planning for the user interviews, writing the discussion guide and starting a knowledge kanban, collating everything we already know about the opportunities we’ve exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a product perspective, this mostly meant that I was looking at all contact we’ve had from service teams asking for particular solutions, quantifying the demand and checking on whether teams’ problems were common enough to warrant a centrally-built GaaP solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started mapping our assumptions about these opportunities, calling out our gut feels or poorly evidenced ideas for the value, viability and feasibility of this opportunities. For example, my biggest assumption is that services don’t need Direct Debit in the long term, they need a way for users to pay them on a recurring basis and we can enable bank-to-bank payments via other methods. We mapped those on a grid with two axes: how much evidence we have for this assumption, and how important it is to get it right. Anything trivial can be explored through prototyping or engagement rather than direct interviews with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a cross-government buddying scheme for product managers. It’s a really simple thing I’ve been running at GDS for a couple of years, mainly involves me collecting some contact details and pairing people up. Around 24 people have signed up so far, which is nice, giving people the chance to chat to product managers outside their organisation bubble. Check out cross-gov Slack if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the above point and having thought more about the product management community over the last couple of weeks, I’m wondering whether anyone is looking at communities through the lens of training, coaching and skills development. It sounds like a couple of product leaders are doing well on that front, but there’s a few other places in dire need of good foundations in product management – not only for their newly appointed PMs but also the wider organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following my weeknotes recently, you’ll know that I interviewed for a senior product manager position at GDS. The good news is that I got offered the position! I’m really appreciative of that vote of confidence in my skills, that I’m operating at a senior level. However, I decided to turn it down. There’s a few reasons for this, but ultimately it comes down to team dynamics and how much of myself I’ve invested in my role. Leaving the team in the next 6 weeks, while we’re building momentum and adding more certainty to our 2-year roadmap, would be too disruptive as we’ve experienced high staff turnover in the last 12 months. So I’m staying put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it sounds like there won’t be any other senior positions coming up in Government as a Platform, the programme we’re in, so I’ll continue interviewing elsewhere for senior roles and see what happens. If I were to leave, it would be less disruptive to do so after the alpha stage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Disco</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished off the analysis of people’s contributions to the Work–Life Impact workshops. When reading back the findings, many of the things we want to try seem obvious – get feedback early and often, make time to chat about non-work things, set a daily schedule, etc. – which highlights just how easy it is to not keep up good working habits. Official blog post coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local government community session I mentioned last week went really well, and it was great to see the community helping out other members – even when the solution wasn’t GOV.UK Pay! I think that’s important to emphasise as we’re not an all-in-one solution, and if anything seeking out The One Platform to Rule Them All is what got so many organisations locked in to exploitative contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my week was spent kicking off the discovery into new payment types and channels, which will help inform GOV.UK Pay’s strategy over the next couple of years. Currently the platform only offers one-off card payments and two channels, digital and telephone, but we know that services need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invited our stakeholders to join the team in the inception workshop, meaning that our director and deputy director could pitch ideas alongside senior management and specialists working on the frontline, in my team. Though some were worried about the psychological safety of that, it didn’t seem to impede people’s contributions. It hopefully made our new leadership feel closer to its product teams too, helping them better understand the decisions we weigh up each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest job was keeping the conversation moving and raising questions on people’s Post-its. (We used a Mural board for the workshop.) You’re often thinking on your feet when facilitating a workshop, reviewing people’s contributions and working out what questions to ask to make things more specific. The 5 Whys help, as well as asking people to elaborate more. And writing down points as people expand on them helps, as they instantly see things recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, I wrote down some ‘Discovery is done when’ objectives and we discussed those as a team the next day. Over an hour or two, we discussed the approach we wanted to take as a team and refocused the perspective of our objectives to talking about value, motivations and pain points rather than anything related to a specific solution. This is glorious as it shows the team is in the same headspace, thinking in the same way, which gives me a lot of hope for the next 8 weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying too that this discovery is more like customer development than researching users’ needs. We’re looking at questions of value and viability most, learning more about why services hire GOV.UK Pay to solve their problems and how common those problems are across services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the week with a really decent plan for the next 8 weeks and with placeholder events in our calendars, so I’m feeling really confident that we’ll make good progress and use the time well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No puzzles this week. Nothing on my mind, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interview for a senior product manager role at GDS seemed to go well, and I hear back on Tuesday. There’s a new approach to interviews where people are being sent the interview questions beforehand, which I think was really inclusive. It really helps not having to scramble around for stories related to the questions, knowing the questions in advance means you can bring well formed responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran a personal best for a 5K last week, at 22 minutes and 53 seconds. I’m aiming to get that down to 22 minutes so spent the week working on form and pace, pushing myself more than I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Water</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached the end of series 10 with the closure of one mission, a discovery unfolding from next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission to make Pay and its partner services compliant with Strong Customer Authentication regulations is all wrapped up, and we know what we’d do next to iterate the paying user journey. For now we’ll focus on releasing improvements for accessibility only, because the paying user journey works well enough for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always preferable to implement changes after research and design, of course, so that you keep that momentum, but there are two higher priority things to be working on. Working in digital is all about making trade-offs, and we’re consciously shifting capacity towards things that will pay off in the future rather than have an immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the last few tweaks to the discovery kick-off session and our loose plans, after running it past our user researcher, Nick, who came back off paternity leave. I’m confident that we’re in good shape for the discovery now, and lining up people to interview in the weeks before kick-off should pay off. A good thing to have learned from previous discoveries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimum viable product (MVP) for telephone payment links is making progress and will be ready for private beta participants soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the second training session with General Assembly for becoming a lead instructor. Teachers do so much, and so well, eh? Arfah and I also ran through the moderating training with Mary, in readiness for the public launch of the Introduction to Product Management course on FutureLearn. Look out for the blog post in 2–3 weeks’ time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started an analysis of people’s contributions to the Work–Life Impact workshops. I’ll save the insights for another blog post, but the most striking finding was how much people aren’t leaning on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-development-handbook/community-development-handbook#what-a-community-of-practice-is&quot;&gt;community of practice&lt;/a&gt; for support – the people you can go to whenever personal or professional struggles become more acute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this that spring to mind, and the communities have been degrading for some time. First slowly, then all at once. But I do think they’re in a position to be built up back to strength. Immediately I’m reminded of Matt Edgar’s meeting with an aquarium curator and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mattedgar.com/2018/06/06/look-after-the-water-reflections-1-year-into-my-work-at-nhs-digital/&quot;&gt;look after the water&lt;/a&gt;. It was pleasing to see people at this month’s PM community meet-up, so there’s something we can build on there. (And big thanks to Miriam and JP for carrying the torch through a tough period!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of ‘Audience is one-to-many, community is many-to-many’, I’ve arranged a community session for local authority teams taking payments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1357254417104441346&quot;&gt;Come along&lt;/a&gt; if you’d find that useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still wondering lots about Zoom fatigue and how to create spaces for collaboration during our discovery. I’m enjoying using Mural and it’s massive, seemingly endless whiteboard space. I think the trick might be to encourage regular breaks and maybe even a walk-and-talk over Slack audio for gnarly problems. Not having a delivery manager means I’m thinking about other people’s energy a lot more, which can only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interview date for a senior product manager role at GDS came through, which I’m really excited about. Fingers crossed. 🤞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My running is progressing and on Monday I ran my first 10K on a gloriously sunny day. Spoilt! My left calf was tight afterwards and the following day too, which meant on Wednesday I only ran 6K – and a lot slower – despite planning to run the same route. The extra rest should mean I can do another 10K today though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On drinking, I had three cans of beer to celebrate finishing a booze-free January and then started a booze-free February. I nearly caved last night but when it came time to actually go to the shops, I didn’t really want one any more. Not having 24-hour corner stores a 1-minute walk away is helping snacking and boozing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took a day off on Friday, but did close to nothing with it. I actually did some work but hey, what else is there to do? Looking forward to being able to go to Snowdonia again, cannot wait!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Third Birthday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was my GDS 3rd birthday 🥳 and I still feel quite lucky to work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been a tough one this week, if I’m honest. A full to-do list at work and then teaching product in the evenings, plus an interview task on Thursday. 12-hour days until Friday, when I could log off at 5.30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing through to clear the to-do list is tough right now too, eh? Chris really nailed it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thomaschris.co.uk/notes/2021/01/29/weeknote.html&quot;&gt;his latest weeknote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst I’ve never been more grateful for the material, pragmatic aspects of my work – job security, good pay – my relationship with it has also never felt so transactional or attritional. Everything happening on this flat shiny surface connected to a tube. I really miss going to a different place and being around people every day. If the last year has told me anything it’s that there are real limits to my introversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the gaps that are hardest to fill, the human bits. But we’ll get there. I think I’ll read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2002/05/how-resilience-works&quot;&gt;Viktor Frankl’s meaning therapy&lt;/a&gt; that he conceived in Auschwitz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time wrapping up the mission, documenting everything we’ve learned so that our future selves have something to start with. Our interaction and content designer did a good job with some content changes but feel like some A/B testing would help settle some uncertainties. Unfortunately that’s an approach we can’t yet take on GOV.UK Pay as we have no tech to do it, not like the stack we built on GOV.UK Search. It’s sensible to want to test our assumptions though, so maybe a wider &lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/27/using-design-crits-to-improve-collaboration/&quot;&gt;design crit&lt;/a&gt; outside the team would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re building a minimum viable product (MVP) for telephone payment links, giving teams the chance to take payments over the phone without needing to integrate with our API. It’s especially good for anyone without access to developers, like centralised call centres, police stations and council offices. I got a bit nerdy about it being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1354511604000432130&quot;&gt;proper MVP&lt;/a&gt; because it’s an oft misunderstood term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did some SEO work on a blog post to launch the Introduction to Product Management course, so keep an eye out for when Arfah publishes that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact-checked our 3D Secure content with our technical writer, Mark. I should have done that sooner; thank-you to David for pointing out an inconsistency between our messaging to services and some UI content 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday I ran the Work–Life Impact workshops I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/23/the-creamy-rips/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone was great at being open with their struggles and helping out their colleagues. I must do a write-up of all three workshops, so that we know which areas we’d like to work on, which gaps we need to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a strategy chat with Antonia, Xander and our senior management team. It was good, but I need to be better at explaining why I think it’s important that we form and track our growth pipeline. It’s a feedback loop that complements our discovery work and chats with services, and it might help us be proactive about biz dev rather than be forced to react to a bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent a call-out for research participants for our discovery. I’ve added it below in case you’d be a good fit for it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-can-you-help-with-research-about-taking-payments-from-users&quot;&gt;💸 Can you help with research about taking payments from users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for people to help us with some research into how the public sector takes payments from users. Chats would last approximately 30–45 minutes between 15 February and 19 March 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re interested in speaking to people and teams who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;need to make it easier for the public to pay your organisation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;may need to take payments on a recurring basis or in instalments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;need to offer an automated telephone payment service for users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have or may need user accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;How to get involved&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contact govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk to help our research or share this message with colleagues who may be interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own motivation was a puzzle last week, but I’ve definitely improved on it this week. Now the puzzle confronting me is the team’s motivation and what that means for our discovery. I’ll need to take a temperature check on that next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything’s been workworkwork this week, so I haven’t really done any other things. One highlight was a lunchtime natter with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OfficeOfWilson/status/1318604853451624449&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend everyone do. It was good to talk about running with someone who’s been doing it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the running, I had an absolute blast this week. A 40-minute run around Llŷn on Wednesday was the longest run I’ve ever done, so I did another one on Friday for 45 minutes. Giving myself an 1.5-hour lunch break and extending my working hours so that I can fit in these runs has definitely helped my motivation at work to compared to last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re running, all you concentrate on is breathing and not falling into banks of mud, which is quite a mindful thing to do. I don’t even listen to music on a distance run because my mind is so focused on making sure my body doesn’t malfunction. Plus you get this massive hit of endorphins at the end (which is really helping with the not-drinking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On drinking, I’m halfway through my 2-month break from booze. The real test will be doing this when the pubs are open again, but avoiding the temptation at home is the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mix of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/andmore/january-discoveries-2021/&quot;&gt;tunes I found and loved in January&lt;/a&gt;. UK drill, hip-hop, grime, bass music and ambient sounds. Screwed evolutions at the end. Good for the weather we’re having.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Creamy Rips</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming back to writing weeknotes for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bunch of people started writing weeknotes recently, and it’s lovely to read new voices in the mix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m doing work at the moment that my future self could benefit from reading back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m here to properly close off series 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I’m grateful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RoxaneHeaton&quot;&gt;Rox&lt;/a&gt;, our director, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://roxane-m-heaton.medium.com/weeknotes-s01e01-4e7f2ffe760f&quot;&gt;starting her own weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; as it has shown people like the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AngusMontgomery&quot;&gt;Angus&lt;/a&gt; that it’s OK to write about work. As he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Frankly, I was worried [writing weeknotes] might get me into trouble at work, so big thanks to Rox for being so inspiring and encouraging about working in the open and for actually doing it herself too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve been umming and ahhing about writing weeknotes for a while, you should know that you totally have permission to reflect on your own work in the open. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/25/blogging-working-open/&quot;&gt;rocket fuel for smart collaboration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are quite long but I feel better having it out of my head. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the week was spent on wrapping up our current mission in a responsible way. We’ve learned some things through our research but need to act on those later, so I spent time updating the product decision record for Strong Customer Authentication and the design decision record for redesigning the paying user journey. There’s a couple of loose ends to tie off in the redesign work which when done can become prioritised stories in the Police Cat backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That meant I got to spend a couple of hours with our interaction designer, talking about how we’ll make 3D Secure less of a hurdle for users with accessible needs and how we’ll package up the work neatly in a presentation. They mocked up some changes, ran it past our content designer, and next we’ll need to review it as a team, so I’ll set up a small crit for next week to bring our developer in too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/pay-product-page/pull/296&quot;&gt;updated our accessibility statement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/pay-product-page/pull/298&quot;&gt;iterated our 3D Secure guidance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/pay-product-page/pull/299&quot;&gt;refreshed our public roadmap&lt;/a&gt; with the work we’re doing now, next and later. There’s a new section listing what we’ve learned from research that I’m hoping our partner services will find useful to know about or that might encourage further discussion with us. I’m still thinking about deeper collaboration with service teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meeting with HM Treasury and Government Finance Function went really well, the relationship is definitely blossoming, and it’s clear how we can all collaborate to drive positive outcomes for the management of public money, for government departments and for paying users. Similarly so for a catch-up with Government Banking Service, it was really positive and I’m looking forward to working with them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatting to Angus about GDS’s strategy was lovely too, it was good to bounce thoughts off each other. Grateful that I’ve got some opportunity to have input and put out something that not only inspires team but gives them a rubric for checking their progress. Direction, guard-rails and a set of coherent actions. Onwards, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy people at GDS do the heavy-lifting on translating digital concepts into something that people at the centre of government can understand, so I’m glad to be working with one of our policy folk on presenting GOV.UK Pay to our new leadership and people in Cabinet Office. It’ll be useful to learn the language they use too, as it’ll lubricate conversations with Ministers and their cadre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked some workshops to check on our team’s health and work–life balance, leaning on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/work-life-impact&quot;&gt;a template that Leisa Reichelt put together&lt;/a&gt; at Atlassian. The findings will help us make sure that we’re providing the right support for everyone on Pay and that our working life is in balance with our home life. We’ll write about how the findings help us, and we need to update everyone on how no-meetings days have been going too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw together a MURAL board for our inception workshop when we kick off the discovery in two week’s time, based on Will Myddleton’s post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/setting-up-a-discovery&quot;&gt;setting up discoveries for success&lt;/a&gt;, which it turned out the Stroopwaffel team had done too. It’d be cool to start building up some resources we can re-use across Pay, maybe I’ll chat to people about that. I also prepped some slides for the discovery kick-off, which will have the discovery team pitching ideas alongside the senior management team and our directors. Everyone starting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m honest, the main puzzle has been how to maintain focus and motivation as there’s quite a lot on my plate…on everyone’s plate. I’m buoyed by the new cohort we’re teaching through General Assembly on Mondays and Wednesdays but 12-hour days will start to grate unless I’ve got some discipline.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Pushing myself physically when exercising at lunch time has been a help there, and the endorphins help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really been enjoying running again, and all injury-free! Quite funny yesterday when I pushed myself &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard though, aiming for a 4:00/ki pace in interval training (8 lots of 600m). I barely managed 4:30/ki at my fastest so I stopped and will try again today for 4:45/ki. Noticing when you’re pushing yourself too hard, adjusting and setting out with a new goal is a good thing to be doing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loved watching Daniel Day-Lewis films recently, hoovering up &lt;em&gt;The Phantom Thread&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/em&gt; in one week. What a star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guilty pleasure has been &lt;em&gt;Married At First Sight: Australia&lt;/em&gt; which I know is trashy and sometimes scripted and definitely not good society (probably), but it’s the perfect antidote to a serious day of work. And isn’t the new UK season of &lt;em&gt;Drag Race&lt;/em&gt; way better than the new US season?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got 500g of loose leaf tea in from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seibiantcoffi.co.uk&quot;&gt;Seibiant&lt;/a&gt; so every cup is a luxury. Get yourself some decent brews, it makes the day sail by more easily. (Also, I can recommend buying a big slab of pancetta and cutting your own bacon on Saturdays, such a treat.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Liminal Space</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in a liminal space with work at the moment. There’s a few new beginnings that are aligned but slightly out of phase. Waiting for one of those to start is a reason I haven’t spent time weeknoting recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re winding my team down to give more focus on two things: providing the migration with team a few more helpful developers, and starting a discovery in what payment type or channel GOV.UK Pay should offer next. There’s nothing useful to reflect on or document in my weeknotes about that winding down, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDS is between leaders, and between periods filled with all the motivation, gusto and enthusiasm that comes with that too. GOV.UK has been working on its strategy for the last two years and done well enough to get a mention in the Spending Review. But that diminishes the pot of money available for other parts of the organisation, including Government-as-a-Platform, so new business cases and 3-year plans have to be drafted, along with the narrative needed to make those land. That said, I’m buoyed by the news that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-strengthens-digital-leadership&quot;&gt;Tom Read is joining as CEO&lt;/a&gt;. I’m looking forward to a ‘refreshed focus’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my team is between states and GDS will be shifting perspective, so too am I between states. I’ve recently had my skills assessed which suggest I’m ready for a senior product position, but there’s no role to move in to – and recruitment is frozen. Other people have reached out to me to interview in their organisation, all excellent opportunities that I’d be silly not to take if offered. Either my next step is a step up at GDS or somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m really in a liminal space. Chugging along happily, yes, but unsure whether I’ll still be working in government in a few months’ time. I’m being cautious where I spend my effort, meaning weeknotes aren’t as valuable to me right now as they have been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a good reflection to have though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy 2021! I decided to wind down properly over the festive break so didn’t really read much that was work-related. I think I’ll get back into the swing of writing weeknotes this week. Anyway, here’s some things that caught my interest recently.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading List Picks of 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, a confession: there’s a couple of podcasts hidden in this list of articles and blog posts. But putting that one transgression aside, here’s some of the best things I read over the last 12 months that either gave me ideas, crystallised my thinking or started to change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a longer list than previous years but there’s plenty in there to fill your browser tabs and bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#product-management--design&quot;&gt;Product management &amp;amp; design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#digital&quot;&gt;Digital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-web&quot;&gt;The Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#qanon&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#futures&quot;&gt;Futures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#uk-dance-music&quot;&gt;UK dance music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#just-good-pieces&quot;&gt;Just good pieces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-hypotheses-to-hold-together-your-learning-thinking-and-making&quot;&gt;Using hypotheses to hold together your learning, thinking, and making&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first came across how to use hypotheses and lines-in-the-sand on the product management course at General Assembly, and I’ve used the technique successfully in a couple of my product teams over the years. John Waterworth posted this on DXW’s blog earlier this year and I’ve referred back to it a few times since. So I’m sharing it with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dxw.com/2020/02/using-hypotheses-to-hold-together-your-learning-thinking-and-making/&quot;&gt;Using hypotheses to hold together your learning, thinking, and making&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calm-product-manager--stressed-product-manager&quot;&gt;Calm Product Manager / Stressed Product Manager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that this year has been hard for everyone. There was a moment before the pandemic hit where I was a little stressed out, and I came across this post. It helped me to notice the behaviours I was exhibiting and how those would impact our work, which helped me shift gear and slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://productcoalition.com/calm-product-manager-stressed-product-manager-da9957bbb741&quot;&gt;Calm Product Manager / Stressed Product Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-takes-two&quot;&gt;It takes two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cracking post from Jukesie that illustrates the nuances between product managers and delivery managers on multidisciplinary teams. Though the roles overlap, there’s a clear distinction between each role’s purpose – and when you work together, as a team, excellent things occur. I’ve forwarded it to several people who were worried about stepping on the toes of their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-work-beyond-product-market-fit&quot;&gt;Product Work Beyond Product-Market Fit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined GOV.UK Pay and started reviewing the roadmap with the team leads, usually preceding quarterly planning, I found it hard to have discussions around what to prioritise. Unlike others who’d been on the team longer, I didn’t have a detailed knowledge of recent history and couldn’t easily discuss the work within the product’s strategic context. So I used this article to categorise our work into four groups, helping us decide what to do now, next and later – and what not to do. I find it’s now &lt;em&gt;much easier&lt;/em&gt; to talk about the value of each piece of work relative to all the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-boring-designer&quot;&gt;The Boring Designer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone shared this with me after reading &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/08/boring-magic/&quot;&gt;Boring magic&lt;/a&gt;, and it describes the design approach I think we strive for working on government digital services. It’s not that you can’t add delighters to your product or service, but those delighters are inherently utilitarian. And when it comes to grand visions: ‘If there’s The Big Idea, the boring designer is fantastic at finding a reasonable step one instead of making The Big Idea the starting line.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russell-daviess-strategy-advice&quot;&gt;Russell Davies’s strategy advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 18 months, I’ve been focused on learning more about strategy. It’s really easy to tie yourself in knots with strategy, it’s such a fluffy concept. But this post by Anna Shipman helped me realise a few things: first, that it pays to be clear, about what you’re not going to do in addition to what you will do; second, that no one person should do it on their own; and third, that if you’re a product manager you’re probably ‘doing strategy’ already, you just hadn’t realised it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/russells-strategy-advice.html&quot;&gt;Russell Davies’s strategy advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delivering-digital-service-this-much-i-have-learned&quot;&gt;Delivering digital service: this much I have learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to think that, because it moves so fast, working in digital needs new methods, a new focus, or something else to help us deliver better outcomes. So it’s comforting to read this post on what made things work over the last 20 years. If you ever find yourself saying ‘Let’s fix this basics’ in your organisation, I reckon this post is a lightweight owner’s manual for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mattedgar.com/2020/01/27/delivering-digital-service-this-much-i-have-learned/&quot;&gt;Delivering digital service: this much I have learned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-hyphenates&quot;&gt;Multi-hyphenates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t always have access to the specialists you need, and some times you have to fill gaps briefly. That’s where it comes in handy to be a generalist or, as Jukesie calls it, a multi-hyphenate. Not a jack-of-all-trades, but not far off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dave-rogers-on-trust-and-culture-in-technology-organisations&quot;&gt;Dave Rogers on trust and culture in technology organisations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I spent all year thinking about was trust and culture in technology organisations. How do you get everyone pushing the same boulder? What makes it feel like a one-in-a-lifetime experience, not a chore? How can we do that in the Internet Age, leaving industrialist methods behind? Dave sums up the qualities of a high-performing, empowered organisation excellently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-debug-distributed-teamwork-as-suggested-by-new-research&quot;&gt;How to debug distributed teamwork, as suggested by new research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who previously worked in an office has been thinking about remote, distributed and hybrid working this year. I’ve always been keen on a more flexible working arrangement so spent time researching a range of approaches with my delivery manager, so that we could &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/&quot;&gt;experiment with our ways of working on GOV.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt;. This framework from Leisa Reichelt at Atlassian is the step we’ll take next, to consider our colleagues work–life balance from a human-centred perspective, designing our working arrangements around needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-web&quot;&gt;The Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;webwaste&quot;&gt;Webwaste&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of everything I’m sharing this year, this piece had the biggest impact for me personally. Though I knew about the problem of sustainability in digital, Gerry McGovern made it palpable through the everyday examples in this article. It inspired me to &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/&quot;&gt;make this website less carbon-intensive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;small-b-blogging&quot;&gt;Small b blogging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post by Tom Critchlow is a lovely piece on the purpose of personal blogs, against a backdrop of content marketing and advertorials. Not quite microblogging and not quite long reads, small-b blogging is all about the serendipity of personal networks. Some times ‘personalisation’ is hand-crafted, not algorithmically ordained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-does-it-suddenly-feel-like-1999-on-the-internet&quot;&gt;Why does it suddenly feel like 1999 on the internet?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Before social media soured us and made us aloof and dismissive, we used to take the internet’s promise of serendipitous connection more seriously.’ In a similar vein to Tom’s post, this piece in MIT Technology Review points to the resurgence of the Internet’s original phenomenon: feeling part of one giant community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hard-to-believe&quot;&gt;Hard to Believe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a post about epistemology and how the Web is morphing the definitions of knowledge and information. If you use Google or ask questions to a voice assistant, it’s definitely worth a read. Very relevant for the next section too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/hard-to-believe&quot;&gt;Hard to Believe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qanon&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having grown up on the Web in the early 2000s, I’m no stranger to conspiracy theories and mis- or disinformation. Every now and then, surfing around corners of the Web, you’d come across something that felt a bit fishy. You developed a sense for which sources to trust and which to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QAnon represents a mainstream cultural shift, I think, a signifier that normal people are now extremely online, not just nerdy adolescent boys in their bedrooms. It’s obvious when you say it out loud but I hadn’t seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following podcasts and blog posts sum it up evocatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, listen to the Rabbit Hole podcast episodes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/podcasts/rabbit-hole-qanon-conspiracy-theory-virus.html&quot;&gt;Where We Go One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/podcasts/rabbit-hole-qanon-youtube-tiktok-virus.html&quot;&gt;We Go All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then read &lt;a href=&quot;https://mssv.net/2020/08/02/what-args-can-teach-us-about-qanon/&quot;&gt;What ARGs Can Teach Us About QAnon&lt;/a&gt; by Adrian Hon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adrian’s brother Dan also wrote about it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://danhon.substack.com/p/qanon-looks-like-an-alternate-reality&quot;&gt;s08e18: QAnon looks like an alternate reality game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reallifemag.com/the-apophenic-machine/&quot;&gt;The Apophenic Machine&lt;/a&gt; by Molly Sauter zooms out from ARGs, presenting QAnon in the context of electronic communications, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finish on the Reply All podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/llhe5nm&quot;&gt;Country of Liars&lt;/a&gt;, which pulls back the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;futures&quot;&gt;Futures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution&quot;&gt;The Necessity of a Boring Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my head, the original vision for Government as a Platform was a strategic design to bring about a boring revolution, setting some of the conditions required for regulatory innovation. Digital government is still on that path, but some of the near-term tactics have changed in the last two years (in the UK at least). Recent moves by the UK, the US and the European Commission to regulate Big Tech shows that regulators may seek to be more nimble and agile in the future too. This piece by the inimitable Indy Johar should helps ignite creative thought in the government digital space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956?gi=b4fc88064db5&quot;&gt;The Necessity of a Boring Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-kin-with-the-machines&quot;&gt;Making Kin with the Machines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘What if we treated AI as equals, like other human beings, not as tools or, worse, slaves to their creators?’ That’s the premise to this paper, which is a wonderful provocation. It’s a really important consideration too, when you consider how many of our decisions we’re asking machine sentience to make for us. If algorithmic bias were a human judge, they’d be thrown out of court (you’d hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebooting-progressive-politics-in-the-digital-age&quot;&gt;Rebooting ‘progressive’ politics in the digital age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly related to the two pieces above, this article talks about the inherent relation between software and politics if we’re to make data a key part of policy-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntouk.wordpress.com/2020/08/14/rebooting-progressive-politics-in-the-digital-age/&quot;&gt;Rebooting ‘progressive’ politics in the digital age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coronavirus-is-rewriting-our-imaginations&quot;&gt;The Coronavirus Is Rewriting Our Imaginations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Individualism is giving way to collectivism’ is how I’d summarise this article. In the Great Cyclical Nature of All Things, the neoliberal core of the last 40 years is becoming more apparent to more people, and a politico-social shift is occurring. People are starting to see the routes forward to a new world view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-coronavirus-and-our-future&quot;&gt;The Coronavirus Is Rewriting Our Imaginations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-doesnt-have-to-be-like-this&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be like this&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking in much of the above and considering the next step forward in the UK, Jon Alexander considers three shifts that need to occur in how government (small ‘g’) underwrites the social contract for the post-coronavirus future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonjalex.medium.com/it-doesnt-have-to-be-like-this-22f0884fbaf&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legendary acid house DJ and music producer, who sadly passed away this year, answers questions from the public. Aside from the unequivocal classification of Facebook as unnecessary bullshit, he also touches on how humanity hasn’t changed in 100,000 years, it’s just our technology that has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still processing some of my thoughts and feelings after reading Nathalie Olah’s &lt;em&gt;Steal as much as you can&lt;/em&gt;, but I’m sharing this for anyone else from a working class background. It touches on the themes of her book, which I hope inspire you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/amol-rajan-break-into-elite-bbc2-documentary-social-mobility-class-uk&quot;&gt;Working-class people don’t need to “break into the elite” – we need to change it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mission-control-a-history-of-the-urban-dashboard&quot;&gt;Mission Control: A History of the Urban Dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been much talk of dashboards this year, the instrumenting of control. This piece covers consoles, cockpits, dashboards and, my favourite, Project Cybersyn, in its short history of evidence-informed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://placesjournal.org/article/mission-control-a-history-of-the-urban-dashboard/&quot;&gt;Mission Control: A History of the Urban Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading this, I realised how much I’d learned about colonialism and structural racism from reading up on Rage lyrics as a teenager. Much more to learn, of course, but &lt;em&gt;Battle&lt;/em&gt; really was a primer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Usually I add things I’ve read to my weeknotes, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/16/going-dark/&quot;&gt;I’m having time off from writing&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>Going dark</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few pieces I’ve written during NaBloPoMo 2020 have been fun to write. Others were more strained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure any of them made a good point. I’d like to improve my writing, and committing to writing weeknotes means I can often lose my steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, good writing starts with good reading, and my note-taking habits have changed recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reducing the amount of things I write and publish, I should hopefully give more space for thoughts to percolate, develop and crystallise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m going dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a clear overproduction of things (intangible and tangible) that have been created uncritically, unquestioningly, without needing to meet any type of standard other than existing. New output is produced everyday due to the accessibility of tools for creation… We have grown accustomed to shutting off our critical thinking faculties… Critical thinking in action by consumers and creators leads to output being respected and valued accurately, which pushes culture forward towards the infinite cultural mindset.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;

        <title>The Stormy Seas</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3D Secure work continues. Nothing of note to report really, this week was filled with rechecking our delivery plan and making sure we had everything we needed. The research date has moved back by a week but that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did whittle our seven design hypotheses down into two though, so that was good. A narrower scope means we should be able to move on to other work in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had quite a few conversations with partner services about their needs this week, new features or functionality we could add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having pulled together some top-line KPIs, my colleagues presented these in our check-in with senior management, which was a puzzle from a few weeks ago. I’d like to see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost steam with NaBloPoMo, but would like to write some more considered posts. Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/01/nablopomo-2020/&quot;&gt;index of blog posts from National Blog Writing Month 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/design/2020/11/rdi-insights-talk-tuesday-night.html&quot;&gt;talk with Michael Marriott&lt;/a&gt;, the furniture and product designer, about boring magic was really good. It was fun just hearing two people kick about and find inspiration in a phrase that had helped our thoughts crystallise too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week I was reading William Morris’s lectures on useful work versus useless toil and ‘the lesser arts’, which struck a chord during the talk. When Ben was talking about the open source movement possibly having a place in design, it reminded me of Morris’s talking about decoration, ‘the lesser art’, and how everyone could take a delight in making a bowl. Everyone shares the same basic method but has opportunity to augment and extend as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on Thursday I watched the Design Museum’s talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/talks-courses-and-workshops-3/the-spirit-of-rave-event&quot;&gt;the spirit of rave&lt;/a&gt;, exploring the legacy of rave culture on art and design. It was good, but watching people have a chat over video after you’ve spent several hours doing the same is tiresome. I found myself wanting for the virtual reality experiences mentioned on rave flyers. Wouldn’t it be weird if the one thing that pushed Facebook’s VR experiments into the mainstream was the pandemic. It is actually like we’re living inside a sci-fi plot sometimes. (Read &lt;em&gt;Ubik&lt;/em&gt; by the way, I loved it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought a wet suit on Monday and have been swimming twice, so hoping to spend more time outdoors. The sea is wonderful and being tossed about in stormy waters is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Propaganda: leading teams with memes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 3 of 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/07/rhetoric/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I looked at the echoes of Aristotle’s rhetorical triangle of appeal in the ‘Users, Trust, Delivery’ three-sided mantra. It told both the why and the how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tells both the why and the how. Short, memorable phrases like this are easy to recall in tense, high-risk moments, making it an effective communication. It not only makes sense, it works. And, truth be told, the phrase was good propaganda too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the people employed at GDS in the early days were obsessed about Internet-era ways of working to reduce waste, giving each other psychological safety to excel creatively and focusing almost myopically on user needs. So those three words really resonated with them, appealing to their views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the workforce was organised and co-ordinated around those principles, they concentrated their efforts entirely on those guiding policies. In his book &lt;em&gt;Good Strategy/Bad Strategy&lt;/em&gt;, Richard Rumelt says how ‘good strategy and good organisation lie in specialising on the right activities and imposing only the essential amount of co-ordination.’ Hacking co-ordination with a meme is truly brilliant, so find out what gets people going. Come up with a phrase to rally around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-your-own-meme&quot;&gt;Making your own meme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a go at making our own meme…though nothing quite as crafted as ‘Trust, Users, Delivery’. (Admittedly, this is a rather in-depth essay on &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt; motto, of which GDS has many!) When a colleague uttered the words ‘Boring magic’ to describe what we do at GOV.UK, it struck a chord. A lot of people agreed with how it bundled up the value we provide in a humble way. We’re not looking to conquer the world with technology, we’re just hoping to make interacting with government digitally less tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/08/boring-magic/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and we made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1226099069996732418&quot;&gt;sticker&lt;/a&gt;, to see if the idea would catch on. People shared the article. They asked for a sticker and put it on their laptops. The meme started to spread. And sometimes, when we’re in meetings, people use the phrase ‘boring magic’ as shorthand to refer to methods for making public services better. It’s on &lt;a href=&quot;https://apolitical.co/en/solution_article/what-is-digital-transformation&quot;&gt;digital government websites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/design/2020/11/rdi-insights-talk-tuesday-night.html&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tactic isn’t one we discovered, it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://gilest.org/2017/stickers/&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;. Propaganda works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-your-leaders-say-to-inspire-action-in-you&quot;&gt;What do your leaders say to inspire action in you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These slogans are everywhere, but there must be more out there. I’d love to hear about other mantras, little morsels of communication, that have popped up in other organisations, so tell me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your meme? What does it mean? How was it made? Why does it appeal? What situations has it got you through? And, most importantly, who rallies around it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Sunset over Ynys Enlli</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a much brighter week this week, both weather- and work-wise. Other people have said they found last week tough too, which might be attributed to the clocks changing. Rhythms were out of step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re 57% the way through our key result for having all services with at least 3DS1 enabled. It’s mostly a comms effort so not too taxing, but it can be time-consuming. Clear emails with the right level of detail will always lose out when people are trained in the art of ‘a quick chat’. It’s an expensive art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a list of outcomes we need to reach to call the quarter done. Hierarchically they sit beneath our OKRs, but with a bit of work they could become our key results. There’s quite some overlap. Having said that, efforts would be better focused on how we report business metrics in check-ins (in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of hours planning out the rest of the quarter as we’re over the hump now, we’ve got many of the high-level unknowns figured out. The remaining unknowns can be turned into knowns through the usual UCD process of research, design and testing. The good stuff! Our user researcher, interaction designer, delivery manager and myself took an hour or so to discuss the riskiness and uncertainty of our design interventions, which helped reduce the scope of what we need to research, design and test. Someone made the comment that doing it that way, over a longer chat and shared documents, was better than more asynchronous methods. I agree!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-started&quot;&gt;Things I started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a video update on our OKRs but, due to software issues on my work MacBook, didn’t finish it and wasn’t able to send it out. Oh well, I’ll try again next week. I want to see if communicating with the team works done this way. Not everyone likes reading emails and documents, and calendars don’t always have free space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that we need to know what the market needs in order to solve its problems, I started drafting a survey to help us make roadmap decisions based on services’ needs. It’ll give us some signals as to what people need, whether those are clear or need investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzles from last week remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and a few other people from the Social Mobility Network chatted to folks at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://patchworkfoundation.org.uk&quot;&gt;Patchwork Foundation&lt;/a&gt; about how we got into the Civil Service and what we do in our roles. They seemed like they were pretty engaged, hopefully they’ll do well. I think if I had to give 16-year-old me some advice it would be ‘Don’t change who you are to fit in’. Stripping oneself of one’s identity – changing your accent, your clothes, and other aspects – is playing into the gatekeepers’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raised &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/692&quot;&gt;an issue on the Kramdown repo&lt;/a&gt; about how footnotes aren’t accessible, and pointed to some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govspeak/pull/192&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govspeak/pull/198&quot;&gt;done&lt;/a&gt; by the GOV.UK Accessibility team to improve theirs. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I’ve narrowed down what would need to change in Kramdown, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/693&quot;&gt;I’ve raised a pull request&lt;/a&gt;. Making footnotes more accessible across hundreds of thousands of blogs would be a win. It shows how government working in the open can make things better elsewhere. A few hundred quid of taxpayers’ money spent improving the government website also improves websites across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NaBloPoMo has continued and I’ve written a post every day. Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/01/nablopomo-2020/&quot;&gt;index of blog posts from National Blog Writing Month 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now one week since I touched any booze. Only three more to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://benterrett.com&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; got in touch to tell me how Conor’s ‘boring magic’ phrase had inspired &lt;a href=&quot;https://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/design/2020/11/rdi-insights-talk-tuesday-night.html&quot;&gt;a talk with Michael Marriott&lt;/a&gt;, the furniture and product designer. Michael’s work looks a lot like it would suit a shop on Charing Cross Road selling things from the DIY section of Abbie Hoffman’s &lt;em&gt;Steal this Book&lt;/em&gt;. It’s beautiful stuff. I grabbed a ticket, and I’m really looking forward to the talk about reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been lots of activity off the back of my post about &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/&quot;&gt;how I’ve reduced the carbon emissions associated with this website&lt;/a&gt;. It has been featured in a couple of newsletters and forums, a couple of people have decided to lower their carbon emissions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://kevq.uk/how-local-fonts-can-save-the-environment/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://so.nwalsh.com/2020/10/31-dust&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), and both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomgamon.com/posts/is-it-morally-wrong-to-write-inefficient-code/&quot;&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/no-your-clean-code-wont-save-the-planet/&quot;&gt;pointlessness&lt;/a&gt; of doing so have been discussed. I’ll have to write a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rhetoric: leading teams with memes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 2 of 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/06/users-trust-delivery/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I looked at how GDS’s original ‘Trust, Users, Delivery’ motto was used to communicate concisely the collective direction and culture of the organisation. The sum of the words were stronger than their individual messages, but in effect formed the constraints within which transformation could successfully happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the words make up the three elements of a formula for GDS’s digital transformation effort. If the focus is on meeting users’ needs, trusting our methods and delivering value, digital transformation can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is it about the phrase that makes it so memorable and understandable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be its echoes of Aristotle’s rhetorical triangle of appeal, which speechwriters use to make their writing really land with an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pathos&quot;&gt;Pathos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathos is the appeal to people’s emotions. Writing deals with pathos when it has an emotional impact, and you can stir people’s emotions when you remind them that all their work is for the benefit of &lt;strong&gt;users&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone cared (and still care) about making things better for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;logos&quot;&gt;Logos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logos is the appeal to logic, presenting logical reasons to your case. At the time, agile methods and disruptive innovation were causing huge change in the tech sector. GDS set about to prove that you could apply the same techniques to transforming government. Hence, the strategy was &lt;strong&gt;delivery&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone had used these methods before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ethos&quot;&gt;Ethos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethos is the appeal to authority and reputation of the speaker or writer, which can be transferred in tone. To present oneself as empathetic and understanding, speak about others and their needs – which inspires &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone was aiming for the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when it was uttered, the phrase would remind you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we’re making change happen for the benefit of the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we’re making change happen with methods we know will work, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we’re making change happen together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tells both the why and the how. Short, memorable phrases like this are easy to recall in tense, high-risk moments, making it an effective communication. It not only makes sense, it works too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I’ll talk about how short memorable phrases make excellent propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Users, Trust, Delivery: leading teams with memes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 1 of 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes are a common concept to most people with an Internet connection these days. But before the multiplier effects of the Web, these morsels of communication were known as mottos, mantras, banners and phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been thinking about how these soundbites are used in leadership. I’m going to use an example from Government Digital Service (GDS) – where I work – as it’s one that’s closest to me. It’s rarely mentioned now but in the early days it was mantra to spur people on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Trust, Users, Delivery.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It filled the gap between management and teams, where the necessity was to act autonomously, with very little opportunity for communication between the two group. People were busy! As I see it, the motto represented a way for management to address teams’ concerns as they went through great change, and a way for teams to express their pride in what they were creating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a meme – collective communication – to reduce the burden of having many, tailored, low-impact messages exchanged between teams and management. A phrase to rally around. It set the direction and the culture of the movement, with rumour and misinformation counteracted by collaboration and quality information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-motto&quot;&gt;The motto&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sum of these words were stronger than their individual messages, but in effect formed the constraints within which transformation could successfully happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trust&quot;&gt;Trust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust was all about teams believing in management to make the right decisions, and management knowing that teams could be trusted to deliver. Trust was founded through shared principles such as ‘digital by default’, ‘putting users first’, ‘learning from the journey’, etc. (There’s more in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/ColemanE/trust-users-delivery-gds-presentation-to-code-for-america-2012&quot;&gt;slide 4 of this presentation&lt;/a&gt;.) Because both factions knew the principles they were jointly working to, they didn’t need to settle people’s anxieties – which tend to arise during huge change projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Users pillar was dedicated to making &lt;a href=&quot;https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120405091731/https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples#first&quot;&gt;users’ needs&lt;/a&gt; prominent in any discussion, design decision or product delivery. GDS was attempting to digitally transform government to make interacting with government simpler, clearer and faster for people. Like user personas, which remind digital teams who they’re creating things for, making users a part of the motto made them central to any considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delivery&quot;&gt;Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Delivery aspect to the mantra captured the overall strategy. By using small, user-focused teams of developers, designers and managers to rebuild national infrastructure in an open way, they would prove that iterative, agile methods could transform government. The strategy was delivery, because results would prove the methods. In the face of adversity, faith in your methods comes as a comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Many of the things people worry about are not really worth worrying about</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I worked with film-maker Tomas Leach on a book for his documentary, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7arEQR8PdA&quot;&gt;In No Great Hurry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The documentary is about the late Saul Leiter, a photographer who made the mundane magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His style is unique. He takes pictures of boring things: condensation on a window, red umbrellas, taxi cars. Moments of urban life we’d all find commonplace. His composition made these scenes hard to unpick, a tad abstract. It would take a few moments to work out what you were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was part of the allure. Shooting in the 1950s and 1960s, he was also an early pioneer of colour photography, which would equally draw the eye after a century of black and white photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saul’s photography was boring magic, without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His style causes us to slow down, to take in more of our surroundings. Inspect the ordinary for shades of delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I wonder whether we should be doing that more. In many aspects of life. We needn’t always be in motion, always moving on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if now is just enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m a person who likes to postpone things. I see no reason for being in a rush. When you consider many of the things that people treat very seriously, you realise that they don’t deserve to be treated that seriously. And many of the things people worry about are not really worth worrying about. If I didn’t do anything more than my little book, would that have been enough? – Saul Leiter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nothing came of the project, unfortunately. I experienced a severe bout of depression and couldn’t carry on. I really wish I had. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Silly ideas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve kept these silly ideas for apps and gadgets in a note on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of them are really silly, bordering on pointless. For a while that was a particular focus, pointlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An app for recording how quickly your toenails grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An app that utilises AI to compute when your urine will start smelling of asparagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;IoT-controlled wind chime, allowing you to turn it off when it’s annoying. It comes with a mini fan for when there’s no wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s one I really want to build: Deliveroulette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your post code, a time to be fed and your budget, anything from £20 to £50. A bot will randomly select a restaurant, pick some things off the menu and place the order for you. A little while later the doorbell rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A surprise dinner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s better than TimeHop for toenails, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Search is the fast-food restaurant of knowledge</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting hold of knowledge is harder than we think. Most of what a search engine returns is information, and it’s our job to piece it together and generate knowledge: facts and things we know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is really, really good at giving you information and lots of it. But, on average, how many of us click more than one link from the first five results? How many of us honestly take snippets from multiple sources and reason our own judgements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making it easy to get to information, Google has made itself a primary source of knowledge nutrition. But it is, at best, a fast-food restaurant: highly operationalised basic sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s bad to rely on these behemoths. Most people don’t eat only at McDonald’s. So why feed our brains, our arguments, our faculties of reasoning, on a similar giant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was product manager for GOV.UK’s site search engine, I set the team a project to learn more about how search engines work. For one week, they had to change their main search provider from Google to something else. Bing, Baidu, Dogpile, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, or anything else. At the end of the week we talked about what was harder or took more effort, the features they missed from Google, and whether they wanted to carry on using that provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people said yes, some people switched back to Google, but all of us learned how to find things in a different way. We had to actively engage our epistemological faculties and work with a corpus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I’ve been using DuckDuckGo every day because I like the way it works. It reminds me of the early web, around 2002, a time when AltaVista and AskJeeves were big names in web search. Back then you’d fall into rabbit holes, starting on one page and diving through links, resurfacing to open up another, related rabbit hole by searching again. We built up information this way. You’d be delighted at what you found sometimes, learning something you hadn’t expected to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That pursuit of digging into a topic and building up your own knowledge base is losing ground to instant gratification. Voice assistants, in taking away the hassle of having to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;, could take it away all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might we make our own information-gathering Michelin starred? What skills do we need to refresh or relearn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These habits of mind – how we weigh up information and find truth –  are helpful in many places. Not only in our work projects but also, most critically, at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We do not and cannot gain knowledge by passively recording reality in declarative sentences, as if we were baskets ready to be filled; instead, we must handle it interactively.” – Luciano Floridi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>The free-range future of work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For organisations that use computers to get stuff done, the Internet means you can spread bits of your organisation out geographically (over a map) and temporally (over time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading a workforce geographically is usually called remote working or distributed working. That’s when workers aren’t necessarily close to the location of the main office, they live and work elsewhere. There’s also hybrid working, which is when people are expected to come into an office some times but can work from wherever they like the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading a workforce temporally is usually called flexible working or asynchronous working. That’s when workers aren’t always required to be working at the same time as each other. Although more often than not, there’s usually some ‘core hours’ workers have to be present and available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, some groups of people have experimented with the opportunity the Internet has provided. It has allowed them to find new ways of doing things or new ways of living. And, for another variety of reasons, some people haven’t bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in March, that all changed. Anyone who could work online, usually from a computer, was forced to try this stuff out. If their company hadn’t tried out these new ways of working, they became a guinea pig overnight. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/f/flowers-for-algernon/character-analysis/algernon&quot;&gt;mouse in a maze&lt;/a&gt;, without a scientist overseeing the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sucks because, as an organisation, you don’t know what works and what doesn’t. Your workers have been forced to try new things and will have reached their own conclusions. Some might like it, others might not be so keen. There will likely be some people for whom the experience has been traumatic, and those people are going to need our help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ignoring whoever’s job it is to do this stuff, I think it’s time for people working on computers to look sideways (metaphorically) and help each other out. If you manage a team or you’re part of a team, it’s time to build your own New Normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some notes I’ve been making on free-range working&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And you might like to read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/&quot;&gt;this experiment we tried with meetings and emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-on-free-range-working&quot;&gt;Notes on free-range working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re trying to create more serendipity for innovation, and make collaboration easier when we’re not in the same place. Show &amp;amp; Tells don’t have to be polished. Share progress, ideas and half-finished thoughts; invite people to comment on your work before it’s completed. This helps replicate putting work up on the wall and giving people a chance to comment on things, especially if they’re not on your team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check in on your colleagues’ home-working setup. Do they have space? Do they have a desk? Is it well-lit and comfortable? People with better working environments have a new kind of privilege, and so we should be equitable in our approach to free-range working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When everyone you work with is on a screen, everyone is more equal – it’s harder for people to dominate the room. Also, we tend to stop talking over each other and let people finish what they were saying. Cultivate that atmosphere, creating the space for diverse or unheard voices to come to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spontaneous socialising is a joy. Create a tea break channel and head in there when you’re going to make a cup of tea or coffee. Start a voice chat, either using your work laptop or some headphones connected to a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person’s role and types of workflow influence their ability to complete tasks when working remotely. For example, developers often need to get their head down on a problem, whereas managers move between smaller tasks and communicate with more people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quality of personal or professional community that people have access to, and the support they receive from those, influences their ability to cope with change. Revitalise your communities of practice by setting aside time for community-building and running workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t let new team members fall between the cracks. Buddy with them during their first week and hang out with them often during their first month. This is true in offices as well as when working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people want to draw a line between work life and home life, but that’s increasingly hard when you work more flexibly or share childcare with a partner. Move to work in a different room (if you’re lucky enough to have one) or take a walk in nature to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manage your energy not our time by scheduling regular breaks to stand up and stretch between tasks or meetings. Have a small snack or a drink every 90 minutes or so. Set work schedules each morning, and have dedicated slots to answer emails and Slack messages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be present in meetings. Disable distracting notifications, minimise other windows, and actively listen to your team-mates. Writing in docs or checking your phone detracts from the atmosphere of shared purpose, making others feel disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This term comes from Convivio, it’s all about having complete freedom of location, time, and responsibility. Steve Parks wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.weareconvivio.com/free-range-working-an-introduction-27eb178db97c&quot;&gt;an introduction to free-range work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Why I write weeknotes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Each weekend I spend around 2 hours writing about what I did in the ~38 hours I spent at work that week. Why? Good question. Here’s a few reasons why spending more time than is necessary writing about work is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-helps-me-think&quot;&gt;It helps me think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is a reflective practice. By going over what you did and writing about it, considering the objectives you were trying to meet and whether you got there, you actively think through and reflect on your work. You spot areas for improvement or things you forgot to do. Whereas otherwise you might canter through working life unsure of what worked or what didn’t, weeknoting makes you mindful of what you’re doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-makes-professional-development-easier&quot;&gt;It makes professional development easier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each month I chat with my line manager about what I’ve been doing at work and how I’m progressing against my professional objectives. Because those conversations are based around what I’ve been doing – and we do &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; – having it written down is super helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-builds-networks&quot;&gt;It builds networks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some times I’ve written about a problem we’ve been having, and other people have got in touch to say they have that problem too. Then we chat about it and think of a way forward, or they tell me how they’ve solved it before. This kind of networking, which happens outside your immediate work bubble, is spontaneous but just as useful as established, near networks at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-builds-social-mobility&quot;&gt;It builds social mobility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from a working class background and was the first person in my family to go to university. That means I didn’t learn about office culture, its politics and how to get ahead as a white-collar worker until I started working in an office. My dad is a builder, not a CEO or politician, so tales at the dinner table didn’t prepare me for where I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve found that by reading through other people’s weeknotes I can get a sense for how things are done. By writing my own notes and putting them out in the open, I have to actively walk the walk as much as talk the talk. By building credibility and showing my working in a sector renowned for cronyism, I’m hopefully proving my worth to prospective employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-a-tiny-tiny-public-service&quot;&gt;It’s a tiny, tiny public service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, the taxpayer is funding everything I do at work, so they probably have a right to know what I’m doing. And one day someone might fill my place and want to know what I got up to. Weeknotes are searchable records of (almost) everything I did at work, providing a history for those who come after me. &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/25/blogging-working-open/&quot;&gt;Blogging and working in the open&lt;/a&gt; as a public servant helps to open up government, form a dialogue with our audience, and share what we’ve learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the scale of public services they’re not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; important, obviously. They’re not universal healthcare. But if one other person saves time solving a problem using my notes, that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Glaw</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It rained pretty much every day this week. Buckets of the stuff. We’ve been very inside this first week of lockdown, but there was glory in Friday’s sunset. After Storm Aiden passes I’m sure there will be more brightness next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain may have affected my mood this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-shuffled-along&quot;&gt;Things I shuffled along&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the services that didn’t have 3D Secure enabled, I looked at their configuration and sent out an email asking them to turn on 3DS1 authentication before 31 December 2020 or payments are likely to start failing the following day. That took up a large portion of Monday and Friday, and reminded how I got customer analysis and comms into a good place with eCasework. Old lessons for new problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-planning, when we think about the upcoming sprint, usually happens on a Monday but this week was shifted to a Wednesday. That’s because developers were at a code retreat on Monday and Tuesday is a no-meetings day, so getting everyone on the same page on Wednesday, shuffling through a couple of different-shaped backlogs in my head and writing up cards, felt taxing. Especially as there were a couple of heavy and involved meetings on that day. Maybe I should be considering the mental effort required in and around meetings and factoring that into how I plan my weeks. No more than 2 or 3 hours of meetings per day, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lightbulb moment for our Strong Customer Authentication work though. I know what we need to do in what order to make sure we hit deadlines, don’t cause services to incur too high fees, and can make the paying user journey more frictionless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also excellent to chat to the Child Arrangements service, one of our 400 users, about problems with the paying user journey. More of that is a tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-puzzles&quot;&gt;Some puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got frustrated about a few things this week, which stemmed from a risk-rating session we had to do for senior management. It highlighted a lot of areas that we find risky and two big, almost existential problems. As a growth-stage product, I’m worried that we don’t have a good picture of new business and churn, where a simple AARRR funnel might suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our account management is also complicated – or our communication is inefficient, maybe both. Knowledge management isn’t fluid, some roles are maybe duplicated. I’m not sure exactly, there were just a couple of meetings where the balance of things wasn’t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staffing and recruitment is still an issue. Losing a delivery manager after a week gave me more things to do, which left me less thinking time – and I’m covering for not having a performance analyst or content designer, soon to lose my user researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have, sensibly or not, decided to participate in NaBloPoMo. Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/01/nablopomo-2020/&quot;&gt;index of blog posts from National Blog Writing Month 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll be updated daily so you might prefer to subscribe to my RSS feed (look in the footer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also going booze-free during November, so writing will help distract me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Hell's Mouth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My week started by chatting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://outofowls.com&quot;&gt;Randy Silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ermlikeyeah.com&quot;&gt;Simon Wilson&lt;/a&gt; about how Greenwich council might adopt GOV.UK Pay. I’ve been following them both for a few years so it was great to get a chance to talk, and I’m a little envious of the team they’ve got set up, it sounds like a cast of all-stars. The chat was one of many where people talk of the need for Direct Debit, which set a theme for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, there’s some rules around how Direct Debit payments are made to government bank accounts and these rules mean we can’t use a certain method for taking payments, according to our current understanding. The method we’d like to use is beneficial for service teams, it automates away a lot of the manual hassle of setting up and managing Direct Debit mandates. This is a problem at the service team level that can be solved by a common software component, saving the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds in duplicated costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of the week was spent preparing slides for a meeting with Government Banking Service to talk over this strategic blocker. All things considered, the meeting went well as we reached our intended outcome – being able to explore the problems for service teams together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I’ve met with departments resistant to change before, it’s the first time I’d been in a meeting on the frontlines of change-making: trying to get across that we’re not just looking to add a whizzy digital thing into an online journey, we’re actually trying to change the way people work and make things more efficient. That was hard, and I’d like to speak to my mentors about what to do in those situations. It’s not something you’re taught in state school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, winning the hearts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the minds might be a rabbit hole here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week was spent on Strong Customer Authentication, shuffling the team along with journey-mapping and having input on research briefs, as well as responding to comments on my RFC for cookie-less analytics. We need some quantitative data to help us set baselines and observe changes in conversion rates, and having three cookies banners pop up in one service would be a shite experience. We don’t need Google Analytics when privacy-friendly ways of collecting that data exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also caught up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://steveparks.co.uk&quot;&gt;Steve Parks&lt;/a&gt; to chat about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.weareconvivio.com/free-range-working-an-introduction-27eb178db97c&quot;&gt;free-range working&lt;/a&gt;. We’re running experiments to find our hybrid-working approach at GOV.UK Pay, one that will be well established and works for everyone as soon as the pandemic ends and we’re able to be back in the office. The last two weeks I’ve been thinking a lot about socialising and human connection when we can’t be together. Steve’s team were holding collective tea breaks, an idea I’d had with a colleague last week – so, having validated the idea, I went ahead and set one up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I want a cup of tea or coffee, I join the #govuk-pay-teabreak channel on Slack and start an audio chat. I notify people that I’m making a cuppa and they start to join. We spend 10 minutes chatting about whatever we like, then go back to the day job. There are many moments for spontaneous socialising, but lifting it from text chat to voice chat feels like we’re a little closer. (And the beauty of the spontaneity, unlike an arranged fika, is that you never know who’s going to turn up for a chat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I want to map our team’s work–life environment, so that we can better support the team members that need it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Relocation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So that’s it, I’m no longer living in London. Now I live in Wales, and we’re about to enter a second national lockdown, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gov.wales/national-coronavirus-fire-break-to-be-introduced-in-wales-on-friday&quot;&gt;firebreak&lt;/a&gt; (only not the kind of firebreak I’m used to). Because I spent most of last week moving house or working from a friend’s lounge, I’m writing these belatedly and my memory of last week is fading. So, I’ll cover a few highlights and move along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Economics team presented on how they measure the benefits of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020&quot;&gt;Government Transformation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; after I requested it in an all-staff event. It was really good and 40-odd people joined the call, which shows that more sharing events like this would be good. They’ve promised to run a follow-up session on what we’ve learned from that strategy – from mistakes as well as successes – that will help the organisation adapt and form new strategies. I’m really grateful that the team are sharing this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested the paying user journey to see what happens during &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dsecure2.com&quot;&gt;3D Secure 2&lt;/a&gt;, so that we know the impact it will have on users. It’s hard to step through this journey without using real card details, so I ended up sharing my debit card details with the team. Heck of a way to build trust! Unfortunately I didn’t need to do any verification, so we might have to try again with a different card and a higher transaction amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Tobi’s kick-off document template to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tobiogunsina.com/creating-alignment-during-product-discovery/&quot;&gt;create alignment during product discovery&lt;/a&gt;, which nicely framed all the knowns and unknowns we need to pull out and talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met with our new senior responsible owner, Rox, who has been a fan of GOV.UK Pay for years and is excited about the strategic possibilities we’re exploring. She empathised with our need for customer success/growth capabilities too. We made the link with her through our weeknotes, which she said were clearly written and easy to understand. I’m proud of that. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government Finance Function chatted to us about Direct Debit and Government Banking Service, ahead of a meeting we have scheduled. It’s good to have their support in making it easier for service teams to take payments from users without access to a credit or debit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My delivery manager and I roadmapped the quarter: some loose dates and what might happen. Laying that out and talking it through with someone helps to either firm up plans or move things around. Strategies are adaptive and playing out the possible futures is an exercise in adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pigeons in the Station</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Q3 2020/21 and much of my week was spent kicking off our latest piece of work. The paying user team (that’s us) have three main workstreams: operational improvements and maintenance work, increasing the conversion rate on the paying user journey, and implementing Strong Customer Authentication. You can see this on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/roadmap/&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been a mostly tech team until now, but this week we welcomed an interaction designer and user researcher to join our ranks. This is important because it allows us to assess the impact of Strong Customer Authentication on different users with different needs. We want to find out where it’s helpful and where it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Leads team we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liberatingstructures.com/31-ecocycle-planning/&quot;&gt;ecocycle planning&lt;/a&gt; to assess our areas of work and which were stagnating or ripe for renewal, or where we had too little capacity to focus on something important. It was great to get a sense of our flow, the work we do about the work, and gave us ideas for improving certain business processes. For example, the model for how GDS engages with other bits of government has changed, which doesn’t necessarily suit our ‘sales and marketing’ needs – so our engagement and growth model is ripe for renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xander and I published a blog post about the week the team experimented with asynchronous communication: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/&quot;&gt;what happened when we stopped having meetings and sending emails&lt;/a&gt;. We also had our first batch of no-meetings days, on Tuesday and Friday, and I really appreciated the time to get my head down. It allowed me to read up on Strong Customer Authentication and consider a few different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday I worked from a co-working space and got a lot done. It was mildly worrying whenever someone sneezed or coughed, but I’m hoping that the 2m+ distancing and good air flow in the building means I’m relatively safe. It’s a really nice space and is managed very well, so if you need an affordable desk space in south-east London, do check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hatchamhouse.com&quot;&gt;Hatcham House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Week Between</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-thoughts&quot;&gt;Work thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t work at GDS this week, I spent the week working with General Assembly, teaching product management to people from H&amp;amp;M. I’ve been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/steve-messer/19440&quot;&gt;instructional associate&lt;/a&gt; for two years and talking to other companies about how to do product is always enjoyable. Mainly because I’m able to bring so many stories from GDS, about its success and ways of working, to people who are struggling to get to grips with a new mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘If the UK government can do it, I’m sure we can.’ That was someone’s response to adopting agile this week. It made me really proud, and thankful that I work in an organisation that has made that change. I’m grateful that I can coach these people, albeit briefly, in how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the week, the learners were asking about the product manager’s role and where their responsibilities end. ‘Should the scrum master fulfil this role? Is it too much for the capability lead to do X? Is it right that the product manager shouldn’t also be doing Y?’ The answer to these questions is often ‘It depends’, but I kept being reminded of one particular phrase: ‘The unit of delivery is the team.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job titles are helpful, yes, and it’s good to know which roles people should generally fill, but at the end of the day you’re just a bunch of people working together to do something. Find whatever works, and be open to changing your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section on continuous discovery was great, I always enjoy that bit. It was nice to tell them a story of how we validated hunches and improved things for users too. For example, when we noticed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1108401818474856448&quot;&gt;mobile usage overtook desktop usage in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, we had a hypothesis that improving the search experience on mobiles would be beneficial. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1153326845036814337&quot;&gt;Screen estate on mobile wasn’t great&lt;/a&gt;, and we validated this with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/18/being-a-user-researcher-for-a-day/&quot;&gt;guerrilla UX&lt;/a&gt;. This was enough data to cause us to care about improving the search experience on mobiles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, designing a better way to find things on GOV.UK, and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2020/07/23/improving-the-mobile-experience-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; describes what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one told us to do that. Our senior leadership team didn’t ask for it, but they did support our intention to improve it. And now the mobile experience is being brought front-of-mind in other parts of the platform too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s another essential factor of good product teams, I think: having the autonomy to discover problems and develop solutions for users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit of a meh week finishing up Q2. It’s always good to have a new start to look forward to but I wish we’d achieved more this quarter. The main problem was that we work on tiddly bits that don’t build up to a successful narrative or coherent outcome, it’s just little things that need doing. We also spent the majority of our time on unplanned but necessary work, which took us away from achieving the goals we’d planned to hit. Having said that, the unplanned work was valuable and puts us in good stead for future quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a fair amount of time addressing accessibility issues raised in a recent audit by the Digital Accessibility Centre, and I prepared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/accessibility-statement/&quot;&gt;the accessibility statement for GOV.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; ready to publish on the evening of 22 September. We’re planning on doing another round of accessibility research next quarter which will be valuable, as part of Pay’s value proposition is taking care of accessibility on behalf of service teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also keen to explore barriers to making payments. For example, if you don’t have access to a smartphone or computer, can you still pay government for things? This got me thinking, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1309148247768870919&quot;&gt;I tried making a payment using a Kindle&lt;/a&gt;, which worked! There’s more to be done though, particularly around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/strong-customer-authentication&quot;&gt;Strong Customer Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, which may disproportionately exclude older people from completing a successful transaction online. Might be good to partner with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org&quot;&gt;Good Things Foundation&lt;/a&gt; on some research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to demo the new feature we built to hide sensitive card details from call agents working from home, but was hampered by technical problems. I’ve upgraded my work Macbook to macOS Catalina which has a raft of new privacy features. These are great, but I hadn’t presented my whole screen before – only Chrome tabs – so I was asked to give permission for the screen to be broadcast…which requires a Chrome reset afterwards. Darn. Anyway, it was hilariously ironic because I said I hadn’t done a rehearsal but that didn’t matter. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started defining our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wavelength.asana.com/workstyle-aors/&quot;&gt;areas of responsibility&lt;/a&gt; on Pay, to be distributed amongst the team. I came across this in a podcast with a Product Lead from Asana and it sounded like a great idea. The main aim is to give an individual responsibility for a few areas, so that they’re the most knowledgable person on that subject. We have areas tacitly assigned to people at the moment but it’d be good to share things evenly and make it more formal. I made some &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/09/26/notes-on-areas-of-responsibility/&quot;&gt;notes on areas of responsibility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xander and I finished writing our blog post about asynchronous communication, keep an eye on the GDS blog for it. You can receive updates by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/subscribe/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/feed/&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;! There’s a couple more experiments we want to run to determine our approach to free-range working, how we use the office and meeting our team members’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really excited to have a user researcher, interaction designer and new delivery manager join us next quarter, as well as another developer. Good to finally have a properly-staffed multidisciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad to be missing firebreak next week, but it’ll be fun teaching at General Assembly again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah, Bushy Park is a bit nice, innit? It’s at the start of London Loop section nine, which we walked last weekend, and it’s bloody glorious. We saw deer, birds, fish, pretty trees, and a couple of stags chanting that guttural rutting croak. A stark contrast to the end of section nine which spends the last 2 miles in Heathrow’s flight path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000kmkc&quot;&gt;Radio 4 Analysis programme&lt;/a&gt; about how governments can help societies abandon rampant short-termism and adopt a more long-term approach was really good, particularly considering the epoch we’re in. It also meshed nicely with &lt;em&gt;The Value of Everything&lt;/em&gt; book by Mariana Mazzucato that I’m reading. In essence, because everyone’s focused on making short-term gains / profits / political successes, very few people consider what we want to happen in the long term. We’re told ‘Everything is variable in the long term’ which is true, but it doesn’t mean we can’t develop and iterate strategies for reaching a brighter future. For example, GOV.UK and (hopefully) GOV.UK Pay are likely to be around forever – tech isn’t going away – so how might that alter what we put forward in business cases and the Comprehensive Spending Review? &lt;em&gt;It’s starting to get rather work-based now, so I’ll stop…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little under three weeks until I move house, so packing and arranging things continues. I got rid of a bunch of stuff and left some unwanted tech on the street, which got taken quickly. Hope people enjoy that Xbox 360, I barely used it. Can’t wait to be near the sea again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to get better at keeping notes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes on areas of responsibility</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Areas of responsibility are assigned to people so that when someone asks ‘Can anyone tell me what X is supposed to do?’, there is someone who can give a clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It enforces accountability. As product people, we control the horizontal and the vertical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The accountability mindset extends down the ranks. At Apple there is never any confusion as to who is responsible for what. Internal Applespeak even has a name for it, the “DRI,” or directly responsible individual. Often the DRI’s name will appear on an agenda for a meeting, so everybody knows who is responsible. “Any effective meeting at Apple will have an action list,” says a former employee. “Next to each action item will be the DRI.” A common phrase heard around Apple when someone is trying to learn the right contact on a project: “Who’s the DRI on that?”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By designating accountability across the product organisation, we ensure the things that need to happen do happen – and only what needs to be done. If we have a gap, we hire for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As people develop deep knowledge around an important area, they also become the best person to triage those problems. When someone else needs to take over, we encourage transparent distribution of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product people should be empowered to delegate and decrease operational work and change aspects of the process or environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, each AoR comes with reactive responsibilities and proactive improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-areas&quot;&gt;Example areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incomplete list, to give an idea of areas of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Branding &amp;amp; positioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Costs &amp;amp; benefits model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer development and partnerships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Account management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roadmapping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility and web performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payments landscape and competition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payments regulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contracts and cost-efficiencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality of integrations with suppliers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct Debit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strong Customer Authentication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Banking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enterprise resource planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-share-areas&quot;&gt;How to share areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a spreadsheet with areas of responsibility as rows in the first column. Add responsible owners as columns to the side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get each person to mark how much they know about an area, e.g. 0–5: 0 for Nothing; 1 for Little; 5 for Lots, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to share the responsibility equally, noting where a transfer of knowledge can take place. For example, where a person who marked 0–2 can be taught by a person who marked 3–5.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, have a conversation about whether there are too many areas to be owned by the current number of owners, or whether some areas aren’t pertinent to the current strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;These are brief notes, only the things of note, because I’ve not written anything in the last two weeks, but it’s useful to have stuff written down that I can refer back to. Grateful to buy back some brain space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on strategy stuff has been great, and we made a decision on whether to partner with a service team on delivering a new payment type. In short: yes, but not now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mobbed on getting the accessibility work over the line ready for today. It went well but maybe we could organise things better in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s big changes at work and the shape of the organisation is shifting. They’re moving around the Duplo blocks. Meh. But an all-staff conference had some excellent, exciting stories put forward. Good product stuff, and considerations of what makes product work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like our team has a better flow now than we did a few months ago, which is ideal. I’m looking forward to exploring new value-generating opportunities for Pay next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished Couch to 5K! It’s bloody awesome, you should do it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve done 10 out of 24 sections of the London Loop, which I’m also proselytising about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/09/05/the-beach-below-sea-level/&quot;&gt;Last episode&lt;/a&gt; I asked ‘Is the second wave here?’ and I think we can safely say it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we’ve been enjoying our final weeks in London, it has been quite indulgent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What does it mean to 'personalise' government?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For much of 2019, I led a couple of teams working on the idea of personalisation in government services. I haven’t written about it much because it wasn’t really made known in the public domain. However, the personalisation project has been mentioned in several recent blog posts recently (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/11/05/transforming-gov-uk-the-future-of-digital-public-services/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/28/update-on-the-future-of-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2020/06/25/the-2020-to-2021-gov-uk-roadmap/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/gds-minister-states-ambition-for-single-sign-on-for-whitehall-services/&quot;&gt;announced by Julia Lopez MP&lt;/a&gt; so it’s sensible to share the thinking we did, to make it open. Sharing our thinking out loud helps the people who come after us, and we wouldn’t have got far on the project without openly available documents of people’s thinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a blog post that sums up our initial 3-month exploration. There was a great team on this and people put in effort generously, at a time when we were needed to work on Brexit-related content projects too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the project came to us initially, it was all about working out how we do personalisation, but we flipped that: we asked ourselves ‘What would it mean to personalise the experience of interacting with government?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-the-dots-expose-the-seams-making-government-more-user-centred&quot;&gt;Join the dots, expose the seams: making government more user-centred&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People only interact with government when they have to – they just want to do a thing and get on with their life. GOV.UK’s job as the digital interface between people and government is to make that interaction as straightforward and convenient as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that sometimes the way digital public services are built can create a hurdle, making it harder for users to finish what they’re trying to do. They might have to click through pages and pages of links, or they might not be able to find the next thing they need to do, or they might have such complex needs that there isn’t one piece of content or a single service that can help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why our product teams are constantly exploring ways to make it simpler, clearer and faster for people to find government information and services on GOV.UK. One aspect we’ve been looking at recently is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customization-personalization/&quot;&gt;personalisation&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what we’ve found out about how personalisation might work on GOV.UK and what we’re doing next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital landscape and how we interact with products and services has changed and, as Jen has pointed out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/11/05/transforming-gov-uk-the-future-of-digital-public-services/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK has not kept pace&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a reason for that: we don’t want to introduce whizzy new technologies that could end up being expensive or harmful, which is why we keep things simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As designers and technologists, we keep an eye on these things and work out when it’s appropriate to apply new methods based on user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s clear that on GOV.UK, we’re now in a strong position to look at what personalisation might mean for users. Over the last 7 years, we’ve taken nearly 2,000 government websites and combined them into a single site. We’ve worked to improve the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/06/29/finding-things-how-were-breaking-down-the-silos-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/17/training-algorithms-to-create-related-content-links/&quot;&gt;links between the content&lt;/a&gt;, now we have a base from which we can truly meet user needs and design content and services around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our teams and teams across government also have strong data and design functions: our cross-domain analytics allow us to see whole user journeys; our Data Labs team can clean, process and analyse large datasets; and there are more service designers embedded within teams across government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-did&quot;&gt;What we did&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a GOV.UK team started to explore personalisation. Initially, we took an open approach to exploring it as an opportunity space, aiming to learn as much as we could, through interviews, desk research and speculative designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOV.UK is sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/the-smart-state/&quot;&gt;compared to web services like Facebook, Amazon or Google&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike those private-sector services, GOV.UK isn’t motivated by clicks or increasing engagement; rather, we’re interested in minimising the time people spend on GOV.UK – we want people to be able do the things they need to do and get on with their lives. So we needed to understand what tailoring services and content means in the government domain, for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://scottcolfer.com/2019/03/19/value-without-profit.html&quot;&gt;public value not profit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a distinction and learn about their approaches, our desk research detailed personalisation in services offered by the BBC, Facebook, Apple, Google, Twitter and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been useful in helping us break down the word ‘personalisation’ into more tangible definitions, to show how those dynamic interactive services work. For example: Facebook requires users to have an account and tailors its service based on personal data; whereas Amazon and the BBC make product recommendations based on browsing behaviour and aggregated, non-personal analytics. You don’t need to sign in to see a relevant recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also interviewed 8 international governments – including Estonia, New Zealand, Finland and the Netherlands – the BBC, and senior stakeholders at GDS, to get their take on the opportunities. After poring through the research and &lt;a href=&quot;https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/05/how-we-do-research-analysis-in-agile/&quot;&gt;affinity-mapping&lt;/a&gt; our findings, we speculated on probable scenarios where we could provide more benefits to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also thought about what would need to be true for the solutions to work. We used seven criteria to place these ideas on a scale of personalisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the assumed solution?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the user’s motivation to use it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What personal data makes it work (if any)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do they trust government enough to exchange personal data for value return?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does the user access the solution?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What skills does the user need?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does a government department hold the data needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By asking questions about the value, viability and feasibility of these ideas, we learned about other work we’d need to do to make government trusted, joined-up and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speculative designs helped facilitate conversations across the organisation about what we could do for users, what we wouldn’t do, and unearthed the constraints we should be operating within. For example, suggesting another service to a user could create too much emotional load depending on the scenario. But, conversely, adding reminders to a step-by-step seemed like a clear benefit for complex, multi-part services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re looking for opportunities to build on our findings by prototyping to meet user needs. We’re combing GOV.UK’s feedback channels and previous research to get a picture of the pain points. Next we’ll reach out to our departmental colleagues for research they can share. Then we’ll start designing and rapidly prototyping solutions to those problems, testing directly with cohorts of users. We need to understand users’ behaviours, their approaches to interacting with government online, and how it fits into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not about forming habits or increasing engagement. This is about enabling greater success the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main goals are to understand what users find valuable, what helps them get their job done, and what’s feasible for government to build in line with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/18/what-we-mean-by-service-design/&quot;&gt;good service design&lt;/a&gt;. Using our step-by-steps as a basis, we’ll look at how we can make completing whole services simpler, clearer and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not alone in this and we’ll need our colleagues across government to lend their insights and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one should have to understand government to interact with it. This has always been one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/04/28/alpha-gov-uk-design-rules/&quot;&gt;design principles for GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;, since the very beginning, and it’s a commitment that still guides our product teams to make it simpler, clearer and faster for people to find government information and services on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s better join the dots, and start to expose the seams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content strategy: Paola Roccuzzo. Design: Mark Hurrell, Kate Ivey-Williams and Mia Allers. Technology: Tim Blair. Policy: Tom Moore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things to do as a new product manager joining a team</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Your first 30 days joining a new team or organisation as a product manager are really exciting, and there’s an easy way to set yourself up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to get your feet under the table, becoming confident and comfortable in your new position. Your job is going to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalbydefault.com/2020/05/06/it-takes-two/&quot;&gt;deciding what to do and why&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of your team, and that needs evidence, intelligence and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Government Digital Service (GDS), we use a Trello board to help new product managers gather that context. It builds understanding of what the product is, why it exists, how it got to this point and which direction it’s headed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trello board gives product managers a set of tasks to do in their first 30 days joining a new team. It was put together by Ross Ferguson around 2018&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I remember using it in my first month at GDS. It was a good tool for gathering the information I needed to start making decisions, and I decided to iterate it when joining my new team on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I split the tasks into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn the product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet the team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn the mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/UjAn4OBa&quot;&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; now has lists for things to do in your first 7 days, tasks you can prioritise to learn the most about a product soonest. There’s also a set of questions you can ask in chats with your team, making sure you collect the most essential bits of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/UjAn4OBa&quot;&gt;Trello board&lt;/a&gt;, make a copy and put it to use in your first 30 days joining a product team. It complements the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/15/essentials-for-starting-and-joining-product-teams/&quot;&gt;must-haves and key things to remember which help me start or join a product team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do these tasks resonate with you? What would you add or change? Let me know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it’d be great to hear from people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Beach Below Sea Level</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stiffkey saltmarsh is a vast muddy creek on the Norfolk coast, exposed as the tide retreats to the North Sea. It’s a haven for wildlife, a lovely little spot. Where the marsh meets a sand bank, you dip below sea level and the horizon is above your head, waves crashing against the beach. Anxiety is in the air, like sea spray. The tide could come rushing in at any moment, cutting you off from the land, leaving you stranded amid the foaming torment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week felt a little like being on that beach. Except when you check the tide tables, you know that, realistically, you’re not going to be drowned if you leave in the next 40 minutes. So there’s time to enjoy the place and move on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can always come back another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about getting buy-in this week: from immediate stakeholders, from your team, maybe even from myself. We presented stakeholder risks to our senior management team, talked about capitalising on opportunities, and tried to get our strategies across. But I don’t think I’d done enough work on communicating those previously, and our delivery manager rightly said that now might not be the best time after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to commit to strategy work, beyond the product–market fit of card payments, is really tough when we’re all waiting the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review. It’s frustrating, and I found myself in the square of despair&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Despite having a proven model for creating public value, we genuinely don’t know whether we’ll be funded going forward. We have to wait and see. And so we may miss out on opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like being on that beach, I suppose we can come back and revisit things. User needs don’t drift away on the tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout-out to our delivery manager, head of product, head of delivery and head of technology this week: you’ve all been fab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some fun stuff happened this week, it wasn’t all so intense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I presented GOV.UK Pay to the government of Bermuda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We chatted to the Local Digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ripa.digital&quot;&gt;Reducing Invalid Planning Applications&lt;/a&gt; crew&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I presented a lightning talk at the all-staff huddle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We had a retro for the Introduction to Product Management course&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We reviewed the accessibility audit from the Digital Accessibility Centre, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We thought about the implications of centralised contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a lot to fit into four days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-on-my-mind&quot;&gt;Things on my mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Culture and cohesion: establishing and maintaining spirit and the capacity of an organisation to reach its goals through leadership&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pioneers, settlers and town planners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mentorship in the UK public sector product community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working in the open and the Civil Service Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of those interest you, send me a message on Twitter or x-gov Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Value of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which, as suspected, has set my mind racing on a few things. Really good book. My Economics A-level came flooding back, I think I’d like to go over my workbooks again (pretty sure I kept them) to revisit some of the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t packing awful? I hate moving house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read lots this week, probably because I got trial subscriptions to &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;. I prefer the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken a week off the exercise to give my knees and shoulders a rest. Can’t wait to finish Couch to 5K next week, and it’s such a great public service. Well done to Public Health England and the BBC for taking that beginners’ running programme and making it distributable and digestible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the second wave here? &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200905090551/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Cases&lt;/a&gt; are rising and there’s more people moving through &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200905090836/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://russss.github.io/covidtracker/index.html&quot;&gt;online triage&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about this since January and written two blog posts on the subject, neither of which I’ve published yet. Reading about the Cuban Revolution was oddly related, and then organisation-wide events at work brought it all to the fore again. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ridgeway</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every day I wake up around 5.30 a.m. This is not because I choose to, it just happens. Most of the time I’ll just lie in bed until my alarm goes off but every other day I go for a run. Except today it’s cold and wet outside and I don’t much feel like running in that. So I’ll write these weeknotes instead because that seems productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after that, I can have an enjoyable bank holiday weekend of lazing around doing sweet F.A.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mondays are always quiet and, frankly, the worst day to be dragging people into meetings. Instead, I favour getting my head down and focusing on deep work, which means the rest of the team can do the same. After checking my emails and getting some things in motion, I spent the day working on my professional development objectives. It’s pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;look at the DDaT skills profiles (I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager#senior-product-manager&quot;&gt;senior product manager&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;note which areas you need to work on, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write down ways you’ll build those skills through your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have said this 3 months ago but I’m working at senior level now, I think. So I chose the following objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute to the GDS product management community:&lt;/strong&gt; a perennial objective&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner with delivery manager to run a multidisciplinary team (agile working):&lt;/strong&gt; I had this over the last year as I was working mostly with associate delivery managers, but now I’m partnered with a senior it might not be necessary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop and deliver a strategy for Direct Debit and Open Banking on GOV.UK Pay (strategic ownership):&lt;/strong&gt; think it’s probably very important to be able to point to a thing and say in an interview how me and some other people made it happen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help adapt our approach to engagement (working with constraints):&lt;/strong&gt; we’re losing capacity from the Strategic Engagement team, so need to find ways to make our engagements efficient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply strategic thinking in meeting users’ needs (user focus):&lt;/strong&gt; being able to demonstrate taking something through the agile phases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that products get used (financial ownership):&lt;/strong&gt; we solve common needs, we don’t create bespoke solutions for one organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each month I write up what work I’ve done to meet those objectives. I’ll need to define an end state for the last four with my line manager, but otherwise most of my work activities contribute to that stuff. I might switch out agile working for something about buy-in and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I was about to sign off for the day, the alert we set up to tell us that suppliers were having an outage went off, so we rolled into incident mode. It was my first shift on out-of-hours escalation, making me a good person to be comms lead. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://payments.statuspage.io/incidents/b783chyng0y7&quot;&gt;announced the incident on our status page&lt;/a&gt; and then set about contacting suppliers and key service teams. None of them – not even the supplier – were aware of the outage, which was a good thing: when creating the alert, we set the hypothesis that it would allow us to react to supplier outages before service teams, meaning we could be on the front foot with sorting stuff out. We proved that hypothesis which was great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the week I continued working on collecting evidence and validating/invalidating assumptions for our renewed Direct Debit strategy I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/21/the-coal-tax-post/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. I contacted potential suppliers to get more details on the technical aspects of their offerings, details not mentioned on Digital Marketplace, and started working out how we’d contract an external team, should we need one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday I reviewed the outline business case for Government as a Platform, including the sections for GOV.UK Pay, ready for submission as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-launches-comprehensive-spending-review&quot;&gt;Comprehensive Spending Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the students I taught at General Assembly asked if I’d be their mentor, so we had our first chat on Wednesday. They’re a great product manager, I’m probably more of a buddy than a mentor, but I’ve been in moments where I wasn’t confident and would have appreciated someone to lean on, so it’s good to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Value of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the train on the way to Hassocks last weekend. Suspect this could set my mind racing so I’ll take notes. Public value, as defined in Mariana Mazzucato’s previous book, is being referred to a lot, so I suspect it could be as enlightening to me as reading &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter and Trojan Horses&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had people round to view the flat as we handed in our notice to our landlord and we’re moving out of London for the rest of the year. Neither of us will be back in the office this year, despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/27/go-back-work-risk-losing-job-major-drive-launched-get-people/&quot;&gt;what’s being said in papers&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re moving back to North Wales for a few months. I’m very lucky to be in a position to do this so I’m going to take the opportunity to save thousands on rent, bills, etc. and build up the savings pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely think it’s a good thing for this to be happening too. There is way too much of a concentration of high-paying jobs and value-generating potential from that captive audience in London. Spreading it out across the UK is a good thing. Looking at it macroeconomically, you don’t want a sudden crash, of course, but there’s only so long you can prop up the market before returning it to its free radical conditions. (And I doubt this government want to step in and control the market, they’re not Cuba.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s the potential to bring city-like businesses to towns. Take co-working spaces, for example, already springing up in towns with good rail connections. Those are likely to grow as people working from home seek an office-like space to separate their home environment from their work environment. With that as a hub for an audience, what other businesses or communities might spring up around it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can distribute the wealth through our purchasing choices in places that aren’t London&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so fuck Pret A Manger. Let it die. The coffee is shit anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Coal-Tax Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing these notes on Friday morning as I’ve got a busy evening: my usual product lean coffee with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattinwales&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; followed by a get-together for &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/event/product-management-public-interest-summer-convening-2020/&quot;&gt;product managers working in the public interest&lt;/a&gt;. It has been an abnormally video-heavy week with only one hour on Thursday when I wasn’t on a video chat with people. Some very good conversations had this week though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly a week of working on bigger-picture strategy things. Contracts, opportunities, and building consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main achievement was using the skills I learned in the designing strategy course to think about how we’d successfully and sustainably build Direct Debit support on GOV.UK Pay. We worked out what would need to be true, for users, in our teams and of our competition, and then highlighted things where we thought our progress might be blocked: by lack of knowledge, not enough funds, few people, not the right skills, etc. Next we formed and sequenced small tests and activities to build up evidence and validate assumptions on value, viability, feasibility and an alternative disruptive strategy. On Friday, I made a start on collecting that evidence and validating/invalidating those assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke with people from HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs and Government Banking Service about government’s approach to Open Banking. Someone highlighted that we should ‘find out what the strategies are so that we don’t end up treading on each other’s toes’, which I thought kind of missed the point. Really we should be talking about the goals we’re trying to reach on behalf of government, how we expect to meet those goals, and whether there’s opportunities to collaborate and realise those goals more efficiently. I left with a sense that one party was unnecessarily territorial, so I’m glad we can rely on GOV.UK Pay’s digital strategy, which is proving itself week on week with how fast we’re scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought a feature into sprint that will help organisations better meet PCI compliance if they need to switch call centre agents from working in offices to working at home. It’s a small thing I’ve been scoping with a few departments and councils, bringing in our interaction designer and developers to iron out the detail, so I’m excited to see it put into production. You never really lose the buzz of seeing features you helped craft be brought into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun to catch up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtheproduct.com/profile/tanya-cordrey&quot;&gt;Tanya&lt;/a&gt; too, she’s really inspirational and seems to have a good story for anything you might be going through. In fact, one tidbit of advice she gave me was used that same day. A little bit of propaganda goes a long way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I found my notebook from when I first studied product management at General Assembly. One note said that ‘product management is essentially a business strategy role’, and that really chimed with me. I think that’s the buzz I get out of this role, and I’m really lucky to be able to work directly on our business strategy for GOV.UK Pay. Making the jump from the internationally popular GOV.UK to a platform exercising digital strategy in the government domain was a tough choice, but I’m building up experience that’ll be hugely beneficial should I decide to move into the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very little thinking or doing done outside of work hours this week, mostly been sitting back and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had fun thinking about how a situation room might be styled these days. WarGames, NORAD-style? Road signs with LED graphs? An articulated bronze statue with an Alexa for a mouth? Somewhere superforecasters can hunker down while the country collapses, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did walk from Merstham to Tattenham Corner last weekend though, along parts of the North Downs Way. It was a misty day so I’ll need to go back at some point to capture the views but it’s a decent walk, plenty of uphill and downhill to get the blood pumping. There were lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-tax_post&quot;&gt;coal-tax posts&lt;/a&gt;, if that’s your thing. 🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I’m going to hike from Hassocks to Lewes, following bits of the South Downs Way and other paths. I’ve done parts of that walk before, heading westwards on the South Downs Way, so it’ll be glorious this weekend with the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Must-haves when starting or joining a product team</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve managed several product teams, always from first principles, and as I’ve matured as a product manager I’ve written a few memos to myself. Things that got us over a hump or feedback I received from colleagues. Every so often I’ll glance back at these memos to remind myself how to do things well. These are the must-haves and key things to remember which help me start or join a product team and hit the ground running, which I use in conjunction with this list of &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/09/06/things-to-do-as-a-new-product-manager/&quot;&gt;things to do as a new product manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a living list, so it might change. Check back every now and then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-foundational-principle&quot;&gt;The foundational principle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As product manager, you look after the environment that the team needs to succeed, making sure we all have a clear view of what success looks like and how we’ll get there. Give them space to collaborate and facilitate them in making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-the-basics&quot;&gt;Start with the basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the product or service?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What problem does it solve? Write that down in plain language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the outcome we want users&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to reach? What is the outcome we want users to avoid?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the pain points preventing users reaching their outcome?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which of those points is most painful and needs removing first? Which one next?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the unknowns (discovery)? What are the knowns (delivery)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where’s the documentation? You’ll need to update it each week, if someone else doesn’t do that already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-in-a-team&quot;&gt;Working in a team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a regular check-in with your delivery manager, twice a week if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure pre-planning is 2 days before planning, giving ample time to refine cards and user stories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-planning should involve tech lead, design lead, and delivery manager (at least).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t risk doing the classic retro mistake of trying to change everything after one sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out your team’s skillset, particularly what they’re not good at, and their development objectives. Try to base the work on that as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create psychological safety and build trust by being open about your mistakes. Explain how you hope to improve things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UCD people work with well ambiguity; developers prefer clear cards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get Show &amp;amp; Tell lined up early, and sing people’s praises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-agile&quot;&gt;Being agile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to know how big the problem is, it’ll help us work out when we’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach, impact, confidence, effort, and urgency are universal prioritisation criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try not to rush cards through: take time to gather context and understand the problem holistically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start small, test risky assumptions, iterate and grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-stakeholders&quot;&gt;Working with stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be open about how the team expects to achieve its objective. Be open about not yet knowing how to achieve that too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t give senior stakeholders a problem, give them a solution or how you expect to move forward.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use senior people to twist arms when you need something from another party – you can’t do it all yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present the risks and show your working to get buy-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do these resonate with you? What would you add or change? Let me know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it’d be great to hear from people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At GDS we tend not to use the term ‘customers’ but it’s still applicable if you’re running B2B or platform products. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Success</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Open and honest conversations, building trust, purposeful retros and designing strategy. Belter of a week, to be fair. This is a long post, you may need a drink. Cheers! 🍻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new goal last week was to follow through on objectives I set for myself in these weekly reflections, and I’m happy to say that I did that this week. I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dnd&lt;/code&gt; on Slack, I set up and facilitated meetings with colleagues to get greater certainty, and that made me feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that we might not have the right skills to pull on that thread of observability yet though. We’ve done some simple work to make things much better, but we need to continue that SRE-type people have more time to focus on it. (They’re engaged on a migration right now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to that decision, I had some open and honest conversations with some of my colleagues. Heck, observability isn’t the thing that comes naturally to me either, so let’s wait until we’ve got a kernel of the right skills to really tackle it. Having those discussions was a real test of remote-working, I think, as you can read the room or sense people’s vibes: it’s all about communicating clearly, encouraging vulnerability, and building trust. People skills are &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1293262545873182726&quot;&gt;hard skills, not soft skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday I had at least one-and-a-half hours catching up with users on a small feature I’m scoping and some product-market fit work. I’m really enjoying working on big things and little things in parallel, relying on documents, Trello boards and frameworks to make the context-switching easier. This is the essence of agile working, having deeper control over the priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatting to someone at the Scottish Parliament about search strategy was really enjoyable. 30 minutes well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a one-to-one with my line manager which was good, but I need to put together my performance objectives as we haven’t done that yet. I’ve been disciplined about that in the past, no point dropping the ball now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1292727545620832256&quot;&gt;Tobi and I opened up GDS’s ‘Introduction to product management’ pilot&lt;/a&gt; to its first cohort on FutureLearn. All the learners are really engaged and there’s plenty of comments to reply to. A mixture of experience on there; I think some of the learners actually know more about product management than they give themselves credit for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our leads meeting, where we usually get together to set a sprint goal for high-level management tasks, we weren’t really sure what had worked well in the previous sprint. So I span up a retro and we spent an hour talking about the work we’d tried to complete and how we work as a team of leads instead. It was really valuable, without that I don’t think we’d have made the decision to talk about the roadmap more frequently or break down big things into smaller tasks. It created some great cohesion amongst us as everyone was open and honest. There’s really good psychological safety in that group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That helped me form an approach for having similarly open conversations with my team-mates (as mentioned above). A post on how &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverog.com/2020/07/15/mistrust-makes-technology-toxic/&quot;&gt;mistrust makes technology toxic&lt;/a&gt; from Dave Rogers laid down some important principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Teams inevitably manipulate information to navigate low trust cultures – finding ways to avoid being held to account for not meeting unreasonable expectations. Instead of providing honest, insightful information, they ‘feed the beast’ – meeting the demand for evidence of how money is spent and time used with generic, copy-and-pasted responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote above helped me realise that being able to provide honest, insightful information in our next check-in on why we weren’t making progress would be more valuable than muddling over the facts – so I arranged some hard conversations and had them. There’s many more smiles in stand-up now, and I’m certain we can still meet our team objective – just need to flex the key results is all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about vulnerability, I think they’re just talking about pride not being a blocker to having conversations. Everyone’s genuinely trying to do their best. If you’re a manager or leader and people you work with can’t come to you for help, that is a failure you need to address. We’re all humans, not work-drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1293120302797512705&quot;&gt;good books managers could read&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, thanks for your recommendations, folks. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1293849025570054144&quot;&gt;sub-tweet about agile&lt;/a&gt; went down well too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we started putting together a 3-year roadmap. We logged key milestones in the government payments landscape which prompted us to start some useful conversations. We also logged some dates by which we need to make tactical decisions, and that prompted us to get workshop dates in the diary for next week. I’m using skills I picked up in the course about designing strategy and I couldn’t be happier about it. Love this job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ended on a high as I outlined some epics with my tech lead, one to improve logging of our interactions with payment gateways and another to retry sending emails whenever GOV.UK Notify (or its suppliers) have an outage. The thinking was flowing really easily and we shaped the work up well, but I was mentally exhausted after an hour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say, it’s been a big week. We took strides forward instead of taking steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner headed back to her parents for a few days, so I’ve been home alone. Not much to report although it was lovely catching up with a friend last Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so there is something to report. I have been testing one of those fitness food delivery services, turns out they’re not worth it. £28 for three meals a day supposedly tuned to your basal metabolic rate and weight loss goals, but they deffo calculated that I needed more calories than I actually do. Don’t get me wrong, the food is all right – the meat is really good, actually – but it’s damn expensive. And I’ve maintained my weight rather than lost anything, despite exercising the same amount. It’s been a fun novelty for a week but back to cooking next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would love to go on a long walk this weekend but the weather might put shot to that. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanguardway.org.uk&quot;&gt;Vanguard Way&lt;/a&gt; from Croydon to Edenbridge might suffice though, we crossed it on the London Loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m bloody chuffed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1294267756108492800&quot;&gt;this endorsement from a WWW legend&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Surprise Entry</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a week of downs and ups at work. I’ve just realised I totally forgot to start setting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dnd&lt;/code&gt; on Slack and use a Pomodoro timer too, &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/31/the-asynchronous-communication/&quot;&gt;like I said I’d do last week&lt;/a&gt;. New goal: follow through on these weekly reflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week started with a big down. On Monday evening, I wasn’t even sure I was good at running a team. That prompted me to have conversations with people though, and those conversations were beneficial. I’d been struggling to define and prioritise work because, wow, there’s really just so much going on. But my colleagues were helpful in working through it together, and we’re heading in the right direction now, I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still more work to be done, of course, and I didn’t do enough of that this week. Next week I’ll deliberately shape meetings and facilitate them, to get the good thoughts out of our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re pulling a thread of work, trying to improve observability, and at the moment it’s not entirely clear what needs improving first. That’s partly because observability is patchy, so we’re starting off with some spikes and reviews. Chicken and egg stuff. It’s a golden thread of work though, as these spikes will give us things to work on, which will give us goals to set and a sense of how much we’re improving things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatting to our new site reliability engineer was really helpful in getting some perspective. I fear I’m a bit rusty on platform product management, it’s been a while since I did any of it! I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html&quot;&gt;Google’s SRE book&lt;/a&gt; to help with my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We estimated that we should be able to process around 9 million transactions by the end of the financial year, which is scary when you think about it. The previous target was 5 million and we managed 2.5 million transactions. Having said that, I’m confident in our calculations (we did so many!) and we’ve got some high-transaction services joining soon, so our estimates are realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a team-wide retro on asynchronous week. Not everyone enjoyed it and there were definitely some teething problems, but we did learn that it’s good for everyone to have protected time to get their heads down. We’re going to try and find some slots in the week when meetings will be discouraged (but not disallowed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/how-to-run-a-game-day/&quot;&gt;game day&lt;/a&gt; to test our approach to incidents. I think it went really well! We communicated clearly, we were calm and cool, and we kept users updated through the status page, Zendesk tickets and cross-gov Slack. The only criticism is that we could have investigated for security breaches sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our interaction designer knocked up some quick mock-ups of a new feature, I felt ready to start refining it with users and we’re getting close to bringing it into sprint. It’ll be good to get my first feature released on GOV.UK Pay! More to come…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some good feedback in our retro that it wasn’t clear how our near-term priorities were picked. Bad play on my part, definitely need to engage the team more in that. Truth is, I just didn’t feel confident in it last week, but I’m definitely feeling better now. Suggests there’s likely work to be done on psychological safety in our team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to meet Adam at DEFRA who’s leading their sustainability efforts. Joe and I joined up with him and started planning things we could do to make digital services and their technology estate more eco-friendly. Distinctly feel that the strategy is delivery with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wrote up the themes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1282637649438814209&quot;&gt;the Product People unconference I’m organising&lt;/a&gt; with the help of some public sector heroes. We’re looking for people to pitch sessions on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shifting landscapes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keeping product culture living and breathing, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shaping the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on that soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completed sections 4 and 5 of the London Loop last weekend, which was hectic at one point! As we walked into Birch Wood in West Wickham, I stepped on a wasps’ nest and the little bastards came flying out, stinging my girlfriend and friend. After a sit-down and some snacks, we carried on and had a recovery beer at the Suprise pub in Upper Shirley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, majorly impressed by the amount of woodland surrounding London. Head out there if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a quiet week without much reading. Mostly I’ve been watching &lt;em&gt;The Deuce&lt;/em&gt;, written by David Simon. It’s a feast of exploitation telly, really, but the characters are great. Excellently interweaved narratives too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that blog posts now have links to related posts, a feature I brought back that was popular on my old theme. Thanks to Sangsoo Nam for merging &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SangsooNam/jekyll-tfidf-related-posts/pull/2&quot;&gt;my pull request on the jekyll-tfidf-related-posts gem&lt;/a&gt;. I’m hoping someone will &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io/issues/139&quot;&gt;update the jekyll-webmention_io gem&lt;/a&gt; in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about adding search to this site too, mainly for something to play with. I miss working on search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is being built on my new Mac mini too! Nice to have a new machine and a fresh dev environment!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Asynchronous Communication</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to write up everything I did this week, because it was filled with lots of little things and I was hoping it would be a week of deep things. But I did reflect on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1289109258508947457&quot;&gt;why I moved from GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; and I’m feeling happy about it. And anyway, we changed our ways of working this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we tried out &lt;a href=&quot;https://alisterbscott.com/2016/07/22/how-we-communicate-at-automattic/&quot;&gt;asynchronous communication&lt;/a&gt; to see whether it might become a feature of the new normal. Rather than everyone needing to be in the office at the same time, using meetings and emails as the main thoroughfare of information exchange, asynchronous communication uses the internet to facilitate distributed working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, it’s good for working parents who don’t have their regular access to childcare, and for people looking after vulnerable friends, partners and relatives. It’s also supposed to be ideal for anyone with an introverted sensibility that finds it hard to collaborate in face-to-face meetings. As a communication practice, it’s supposed to prevent managers and leaders from forcing their colleagues to pitch in on half-formed ideas, encouraging more background work and concise communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the theory anyway. We tried it out for a week to see how it worked for us on GOV.UK Pay. Here’s my notes on what went well and what didn’t go well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-went-well&quot;&gt;What went well&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was more time in the mornings to process emails and plan my goals for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt more conscious of how instant messages might distract or overload people, so I spent a little longer writing out a message to make sure it was understandable and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hit a slump in concentration after a big tranche of meetings, I stopped working and went for a run. I carried on working after dinner with renewed energy. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2019/10/focused-diffuse-thinking/&quot;&gt;diffuse mode thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-could-have-been-better&quot;&gt;What could have been better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday I had 2 hours of meetings with people outside the team, which meant I didn’t get a chance to get my head down as much as I’d have liked. I doubt that’s avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we’re still using Slack for conversation, I did find it caused unhelpful context-switching and created a distraction when someone @-ed me. I had my head deep in a set of discovery questions for a new payment behaviour and felt compelled to switch into thinking about technical operational management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had to send emails with my colleagues cc’ed, but these were email threads to people outside our team. Not ideal, but to be expected when you’re running a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous sprint planning felt a little clunky. We had planned some activities to be completed by a certain time, but we cut it quite close to the wire. It’s probably because we’ve never done it before but also perhaps because we’re still gelling as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is always hard but it’s much easier to misread a message when you only have text to go by. We probably should have co-created some communication principles, such as assuming good intent or taking time to explain yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Wednesday, I felt like I was living out of my inbox more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ill-start-doing&quot;&gt;What I’ll start doing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work flexible hours, so I’ll start being more strict with caring for my concentration levels. For example, if I have a two-hour stretch of meetings, I’ll go do something else for a bit before returning to work some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having my attention diverted by notifications on Slack is unhelpful, so I’ll start setting do-not-disturb periods when I’m trying to get my head down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro helps me break out of inbox- and Slack-surfing, so I’ll use that more next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dead good birthday. Not as raucous as most years, relatively tame in comparison, but still indulged – as one should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birthday lunch at Forza Wine was decent, and I’d really missed Italian food and wine. The staff were PPE’d up sufficiently and the tables were distanced, which surprisingly didn’t affect the atmosphere too much. Having said that, I’m not sure it’s OK to put waiting staff through the possibility of contracting coronavirus, so that’s probably the last time I’ll eat out this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked the third section of the London Loop last week, which was just as nice as the second section. I hadn’t realised that Bromley (the borough) was so green and rural. Gorgeous. We also got to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://moremoth.blogspot.com/2016/05/wilberforce-oak_12.html&quot;&gt;Wilberforce Oak&lt;/a&gt; which I’m sure many of you would like to visit too. This weekend we’re walking sections four and five, I’m &lt;strong&gt;HYPED&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing &lt;em&gt;Steal as much as you can&lt;/em&gt; by Nathalie Olah, I’ve started reading &lt;em&gt;SPQR&lt;/em&gt; by Mary Beard. If you imagine she’s speaking it to you, it’s easier to read. Neat trick, that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started running again and my knee is holding out. So that plus continuing the prison workouts means weight loss is going well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Untiring Advocate of Summer Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Busy but short week in which we ran a user group session and chatted to Open Banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bad bout of insomnia over the weekend, which put me out of action on Monday. Turns out I missed all the fun as we had a couple of incidents, neither of which were our fault but did cause problems for many users. I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1285581678841397248&quot;&gt;incident reviews&lt;/a&gt; and I’m really proud of &lt;a href=&quot;https://payments.statuspage.io/incidents/9tbskz52y2q6&quot;&gt;the post-mortem we produced for the Worldpay outage&lt;/a&gt;, which balances the needs of service teams and our agency as a bundler of other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing teaches you about Wardley mapping more than working on a Government-as-a-Platform product, let me tell you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with our new interaction designer, Rebecca, who I’m excited to work with on prototyping some ideas for new features and their effect on the paying user journey. Using provoco-types as a way to think through a problem space appeals to my visual brain more than filling in a document ever does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia, our Head of Product on GaaP, was really engaged in our chat about coaching. It’s always seemed odd to me that GDS doesn’t coach its product managers or actively develop its talent apart from on-the-job experience, as ‘good product organisations are continually investing in the ongoing development of their product managers’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whenever I listed to podcast about other product organisations, you tend to hear stories of coaching or principles they’ve written for their PMs to follow. It’s a gap that needs to be filled, I think. There’s plenty of product leaders around GDS who could help their more junior fellows, so Julia and I thought through a light way for encouraging those experiences to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time was spent interviewing users and doing product discovery work on the feature for call centre agents I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/18/the-productivity-hack/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. Next week I’ll pull together the user stories and plan time to build and test the feature. I’ll need to write some hypotheses for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check-in went well and we’re making progress on decommissioning Direct Debit functionality (temporarily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a couple of hours to pull together figures for a recurring payments feature. I’m trying to estimate how many transactions we might process per year through recurring payments and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/performance&quot;&gt;Performance Platform&lt;/a&gt; has been so helpful in doing that. My dad mentioned that he’d love to have his fishing licence automatically renew, so I included figures for rod licences in the estimates. And then DEFRA Digital got in touch the next day to ask if anyone was exploring it! The universe is synchronised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first user group session went well and we had good engagements with our users. It was good to give them the space to raise questions with us and share thoughts with each other. We had over 70 people on the call which I think is a big success for our first event! Looking forward to reading the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A call with Open Banking was positive too, they seemed really impressed by GOV.UK Pay’s successes and high growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/greening-government.html&quot;&gt;greening government&lt;/a&gt; working group for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_9&quot;&gt;Digital Nations&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. D9) so that we can try and reduce the carbon footprint of digital governments worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked the second section of the London Loop last weekend, which is a beautiful walk along a brook, through some meadows to a pond, and finishing in the ancient Petts Wood. It’s an expected delight that this is all in London and reachable by train. If you get a chance to walk the route, it makes a welcome tonic to months of lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having finished &lt;em&gt;Border Country&lt;/em&gt; by Raymond Williams, I started reading &lt;em&gt;Steal as much as you can&lt;/em&gt; by Nathalie Olah, and it’s fantastic. It probably speaks to me because I share affinities with the author. I’m from the ex-industrial West Midlands, from a working-class background, graduated during the 2008 financial crisis as the first person in my family to go to university, and spent a bit of time in the world of literary publishing. She helped me realise just how much I’ve been subject to the mediocrity of the middle classes first-hand, the monotonous output of culture in recent years, and how many changes I’ve had to make, to my appearance and myself as a person, to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not being able to run, I’ve been continuing the HIIT workouts and reducing my calories, which has meant that the lockdown belly is going down. Quite amazing what you can do with prison workouts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to the pub for a few pints and, wow, there’s no distancing and no one’s taking down your details! We sat outside but it was very cramped. Don’t think I’ll be doing that again any time soon, especially as &lt;a href=&quot;https://russss.github.io/covidtracker/index.html&quot;&gt;cases in London are rising&lt;/a&gt; slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice to get a mention in Wholegrain Digital’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholegraindigital.com/curiously-green/issue-10/&quot;&gt;Curiously Green newsletter&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s my birthday tomorrow so I’m going to chill and enjoy myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Productivity Hack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Managed to get heaps done this week, all thanks to one weird trick – wearing shoes. No idea if that’s true or not, but I certainly felt more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed the aesthetic changes to this website. That’s because I noticed &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/&quot;&gt;my website had an awful carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; and I took steps to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I had free moments, much of the week was spent doing discovery on a new feature to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works#define-the-problem&quot;&gt;define the problem&lt;/a&gt;. Some government services take payments over the phone, meaning users ring call centres and give their card details to an agent, who processes the payment using GOV.UK Pay or another payment service provider. The switch to working from home during the pandemic has meant that call agents are processing payments in their homes, whereas usually the call centre would provide most of the security needed to ensure users’ details aren’t stolen and defrauded. It’s an interesting problem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to two departments and one local authority, and I’ve got chats with two more local authorities lined up for next week. It’s helpful to get the experiences of a few different parties and the value proposition is starting to become clearer. After discussing possible solutions with the team, it seems like a relatively easy and low-effort build, meaning we could deliver value quickly. That’s probably a good thing as we’re nearing autumn and a second wave is on people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also caught up with my old buddies on GOV.UK to talk about accounts (as mentioned in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/28/update-on-the-future-of-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;) and validated use cases for GOV.UK Pay. We’re in the early stages of exploring recurring payments, a new payment behaviour, as all transactions through Pay are one-off payments currently. We’re going to stay aligned as our explorations continue, so that we solve common problems instead of duplicating efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s good buy-in for this quarter’s objective and the team has been buoyed by a new developer. The energy has changed a little and it feels like we’re going to make good progress. Having two developers on a team simply isn’t enough, so I’m glad we’ll have two pairs of developers come the end of July!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xander ran an excellent session to help the Government as a Platform programme reflect on racism, and David designed the session using his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liberatingstructures.com&quot;&gt;Liberating Structures&lt;/a&gt; mastery. A lot of people were worried they weren’t doing enough to be anti-racist and were worried of doing the wrong things. It was good to show that vulnerability as a group, however. I’m not sure whether other programmes or teams are reflecting on racism together, but I was glad to be able to assemble with my peers and talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be a lead educator for GDS’s new introduction to product management course, which is going live on &lt;a href=&quot;https://futurelearn.com/partners/government-digital-service&quot;&gt;FutureLearn&lt;/a&gt; soon. I met with Tobi, Arfah and Agnieszka to finish off some definitions for the glossary, then took a little tour of the course. It’s looking good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent 45 minutes looking at how Pay talks to users and tells them about new features. Rebecca used a prototype as provocation, which was useful in helping us talk about the problem we were trying to solve. It has been framed as a problem of communication, whereas I think it’s a problem of feature adoption. It got me thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGtw2C95Ms&quot;&gt;milkshakes&lt;/a&gt; and growth loops. I’m going to add a ‘How might we encourage and monitor adoption of this feature?’ section to my product decision records&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re holding our first user group, please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/govuk-pay-user-group-tickets-113322598944&quot;&gt;come along&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing up my website to make it more ecofriendly was a good use of effort this week, and I’d encourage everyone to do the same. Optimise your images, choose a web-hosting company that runs on renewable energy, and reduce page weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to switch from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;-ing my site to uploading via FTP, which is a bit of a drag. Definitely adds 10 minutes or so to the release process, so I’m going to look into SSH and Git features with my new host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow duffed up my knee last week and haven’t been able to run since last Friday, which means my weight is creeping up slightly despite doing HIIT at home. I’m hoping my knee will have recovered by Monday, but I’ll try and fit a bike ride in this weekend. I was doing so well!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This website is killing the planet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I’ve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/&quot;&gt;Gerry McGovern’s post on webwaste&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I’d procrastinated long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ran a web page performance test and got some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/&quot;&gt;grim results&lt;/a&gt;: my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It’s just as bad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/&quot;&gt;using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL&lt;/a&gt;. My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it’s eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how much energy? I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websitecarbon.com&quot;&gt;Website Carbon Calculator&lt;/a&gt; to find out. It turns out that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugh. That’s disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I’m committing to some actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that’s listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/&quot;&gt;Green Web Foundation’s directory&lt;/a&gt;. ✅&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll compress and optimise the images on my site using &lt;a href=&quot;https://imageoptim.com/mac&quot;&gt;ImageOptim&lt;/a&gt;. ✅&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll get rid of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll&quot;&gt;my energy-guzzling site theme&lt;/a&gt; until I can introduce one that’s lightweight and accessible. ✅&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com&quot;&gt;Sustainable Web Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. 📝&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll pay for some trees to be planted that’ll reduce the impact of my website’s carbon footprint going forward. ✅ &lt;a href=&quot;https://treesforlife.org.uk/groves/249395/&quot;&gt;View the certificate 📜&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show my commitment to being a good web citizen, I’ll add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/&quot;&gt;Website Carbon Badge&lt;/a&gt; to all pages ✅ and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/&quot;&gt;Green Web Foundation’s renewable hosting badge&lt;/a&gt; ✅. Once I’ve improved things, I’ll add a &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbontxt.org/&quot;&gt;carbon.txt&lt;/a&gt; ✅.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I’ll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I’m taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Shock of London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We started Q2 2020–21 this week, so I was mostly doing kick-off things and writing OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve reformed our teams using Team Topologies, I’m product manager for Payments on GOV.UK Pay. I’m looking after the experience for paying users, considering payment types and payment channels we offer, PMing the microservices which run those, and other stuff that ensures you can pay government online. It’s bloody exciting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We released our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/roadmap/&quot;&gt;open roadmap&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and it has already garnered some interest from service teams. That means it’s working, which is great! As mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/03/the-commute-must-die/&quot;&gt;last week’s post&lt;/a&gt;, I had been looking into open collaborative roadmaps and the value they provide, so I’ve written up a &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/10/open-collaborative-roadmaps/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I spent time crafting our objective and key results for the quarter, based on some operational goals we’ve been set and the need to help GOV.UK Pay scale. You may have seen that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/performance/govuk-pay/number-of-payments/number-of-payments-number-weekly&quot;&gt;the number of payments GOV.UK Pay takes each week&lt;/a&gt; has doubled in recent weeks, and since we’re scaling fast we’ll need to reduce bottlenecks and improve the experience for paying users. We’ve got two decent service level objectives as a guide but we’re at liberty to choose how we do it. It’s properly empowering to be working like this, it’s what I’ve always wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the operational improvements and reducing errors, I’ll be doing some groundwork on UX for paying users, specifically on our Welsh language features and web performance (to reduce page weight and load times for people with low data allowances). There’s also accessibility improvements to keep ticking along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And besides that, we’re also looking into Open Banking, more on Direct Debit, and how we might take recurring payments. That strategy work is mostly desk research and meeting with stakeholders, though there may be opportunity to build some prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/18auwW8U&quot;&gt;Bets &amp;amp; Learning board&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of new features and opportunities, giving me a place to record learning over time. It’s provided a useful, actionable framework so far. Each feature or opportunity has a doc to record what we know, what we need to find out and next steps, so that we can keep a chronology of learning and evidence-building. I’ve already added snippets of emails to it, and I’ll invite people to comment on the doc next week. Asynchronous communication and &lt;a href=&quot;(https://tobiogunsina.com/creating-alignment-during-product-discovery/)&quot;&gt;creating alignment&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is a bit shit maybe? It’s a shock being back, of course, but there’s f’ all physical distancing going on and everything just seems normal. Having said that, I keep checking this &lt;a href=&quot;https://russss.github.io/covidtracker/map.html&quot;&gt;7-day hotspots map&lt;/a&gt; that someone called Russ built, and case rates in Lewisham and surrounding boroughs are low. Think it’s just all the ambient noise that’s bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on a positive note, I had a mix for the first time in ages and it gave me a right rush. SPINE-TINGLING! Splashed out on some back-in-the-day beats on Bandcamp, subby-dubby numbers, and it took me back to 2007 when I got my first pair of decks. Will be doing more of this over the next few months. Check out my collection on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/andmoretbc&quot;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, if that’s your sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise regime is going well and having a noticeable impact on my waistline – &lt;em&gt;phew!&lt;/em&gt; There’s lots of people about at lunchtime and in the evenings, so I’m running in the mornings and doing HIIT at home. Means it’s all out of the way at the start of the day, and if I fancy a walk in the evening, I can have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise of the week: non-alcholic beer is low calorie, who knew.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open collaborative roadmaps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At Government Digital Service (GDS), having an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/developing-a-roadmap#a-roadmap-should-be-open&quot;&gt;open roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is one of our principles for agile ways of working. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/roadmap/&quot;&gt;roadmap for GOV.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; has always been open, but we wanted to explore how we might collaborate with users on prioritising things on the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making your roadmap openly available allows anyone to see what value you’ll be creating over time. As a communication tool, a roadmap is a great way to have conversations about priorities, for users and for stakeholders. By involving users in the creation of the roadmap, we want to see whether we can form a better bond with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-did&quot;&gt;What we did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out how organisations were using roadmaps openly and collaboratively in the public and private sector, we asked some questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the best open roadmaps you’ve come across? What made them good?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What ways have your team or companies invited users to collaborate on your roadmap? What benefits did that have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions were posed to the cross-government product management community, the local government digital community, and the wider product management community through Twitter, General Assembly and Mind the Product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-found&quot;&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microsoft-teams&quot;&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?&amp;amp;filters=Microsoft%20Teams&quot;&gt;roadmap for Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; shows recently launched features, things in development now and what they’ll be working on next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a high functioning roadmap giving users a detailed description of what’s happening, when it’s happening, allowing them to subscribe to updates or start a conversation on the community forum. It doesn’t show users what’s happening beyond the next quarter or what’s in the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Matt Knight for this suggestion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;artfinder&quot;&gt;Artfinder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artfinder works quite closely with its community according to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/TUuBHO78/community-roadmap&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Users can see what’s in the backlog, what’s been prioritised, what they’re working on and what’s been released. They also suggestions that need further research, things they’ll work on later and things they will not do. One bug / operational improvement is listed, but that’s it. From the looks of it, Artfinder is making its full product pipeline openly available, which is great to see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artfinder use many of Trello’s features, such as commenting, voting and labels, to invite comment and collaboration from their users. They’re also good at adding reasons for why some roadmap items are in certain sections, e.g. won’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the roadmap hasn’t been updated since August 2019, suggesting that they didn’t have the time or capacity to uphold this process (or maybe it was a one-off event).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Laurence Mallows for this suggestion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monzo-us&quot;&gt;Monzo US&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monzo US use &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/5vfbBl1a/monzo-us&quot;&gt;their roadmap&lt;/a&gt; quite actively. They show users what’s been launched, what they’re working on now, and what’s next. Everything else is described as ‘Ideas we might explore’. Operational work isn’t included, only features that appeal to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re using the range of Trello features to collaborate with users too, inviting comments and voting from users. They also link to their community form for conversation on features. And looking at the board’s activity, it’s kept up-to-date and users are invited to get involved often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether it’s easier for the Monzo US product people to keep their roadmap up-to-date as they might be able to port UK features over to the US market. Less time spent devising and developing features may mean there’s more time to focus on product ops – but that’s an assumption of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Paul O’Neill for this suggestion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buffer&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Trello &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/PDIV7XW3/buffer-transparent-product-roadmap&quot;&gt;roadmap from Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, the social media management tool. It’s split up into ideas they’re exploring, work in progress, work they’ve shipped, things they’re leaving for now. Operational improvements such as optimising user journeys are included, but I couldn’t see anything about under-the-hood improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Monzo and Artfinder, Buffer invite their users to comment on and vote for features. Buffer staff also invite users to have a chat over email (which might lead on to phone calls, video chats or user visits). It’s a really active board! Just yesterday, someone on Buffer’s product team added a card to the list of ideas to explore. And it’s been going for 4 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Chanel Can and Ben Unsworth for this suggestion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aws-container-services&quot;&gt;AWS container services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services host the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/projects/1&quot;&gt;roadmap for container services&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/5&quot;&gt;GDS’s Design System roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. It shows features they’re researching, stuff they’re working on, work that’s close to shipping, features in developer preview (private beta), and things they’ve shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roadmaps on GitHub require people to raise issues, giving a place for conversation to happen, in the open, and to be linked to code when it’s released (if you use GitHub to manage your code). It’s great for developer audiences but might be a barrier to anyone not using GitHub regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Dan Blundell for this suggestion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-well-do-next&quot;&gt;What we’ll do next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been useful to see how other organisations approach roadmapping and the conversations they’re having with users, in the open. Miika Savela from the Mind the Product community shared an article from Shipright, a product feedback tool, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shipright.co/post/feature-voting-board-messing-up-your-product&quot;&gt;why your feature voting board may be messing up your product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article points out that you can’t rely solely on voting to help you set the roadmap, product teams should use many of the feedback signals coming in from the userbase to help set direction. So as long as a roadmap is used to start conversations with your users, one way to open up collaboration on prioritisation to show them the trade-offs you need to make, you’ll avoid relying on it as a Magic 8-Ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re looking at our engagement model and product pipeline right now, we’ll consider how we can fit an open roadmap into user group meetings and conversations over support channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-to-consider&quot;&gt;Things to consider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much time can we dedicate to keeping the open roadmap up-to-date?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will we encourage users to look at the roadmap? e.g. which support channels?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What questions and concerns can the roadmap help us answer for users?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do users care about features only or is it useful to know about operational work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Commute Must Die</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s firebreak week! Haven’t had a firebreak since January 2019, if you can believe it. (Check out &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/12/the-new-cross/&quot;&gt;S02E12&lt;/a&gt; to see what I did then. And you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/06/gov-uks-firebreak-why-and-how-we-spent-a-month-working-differently/&quot;&gt;find out what a firebreak is&lt;/a&gt; on the GOV.UK blog.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if firebreak never ended? What if teams were empowered to work on what they were passionate about all the time? Chuck that on the thoughtasbord and let’s snack on it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After catching up on emails, I joined the firebreak kick-off. Though I missed the pitching last week, Xander had written up a pilot for &lt;a href=&quot;https://alisterbscott.com/2016/07/22/how-we-communicate-at-automattic/&quot;&gt;asynchronous communication&lt;/a&gt;, which I’d suggested we could try out, so I got involved with that. It’s fairly simple: we’ll avoid using email, opt for more long-form communication where needed, and try a more flexible working pattern outside of core hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). We give it a go, have a retro, and see whether we want to stop or continue and iterate things. When we had a remote working week on the GOV.UK Search team, it was really helpful to trial it out before committing, to expose things that needed ironing out. And that’s agile working, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my week will be spent getting ready for next quarter, probably, but I decided to work on updating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/roadmap/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Pay’s roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, and exploring options for making it more collaborative. There’s a good history of making roadmaps openly available at GDS – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulb.co.uk/blog/shape-bulb-open-roadmap&quot;&gt;we inspired Bulb to make their roadmap open&lt;/a&gt; – but I’ve previously found it useful to involve users in prioritising items on a roadmap. Collaborating with users on your roadmap helps you figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/blog/where-do-you-suck-where-does-it-matter/&quot;&gt;where your product sucks and where it matters&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll write a separate blog post on our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Faith Reynolds, the independent consumer representative for Open Banking, about how we can make things better for users. There’s been a huge push to make money out of Open Banking but it’s only right that we stick up for the users, encouraging the banks to make things usable, accessible and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a product managers’ meeting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yahoo_pete&quot;&gt;Pete&lt;/a&gt; said that we should proudly bring the Government as a Platform name back into being, and FUCKIN’ A. 🙌 It’s used in digital government circles, in academia, in all sorts of places &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the programme names in GDS. So bun that, we’re bringing it back. (I’ve been using it on my Twitter and LinkedIn because it’s something I believe in.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on John Cutler’s ideas on framing product opportunities as bets, creating value and flow over time, and doing the learning upfront (discovery, not constant delivery), I put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/18auwW8U&quot;&gt;a Trello board to help us frame our product strategy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a draft right now but the idea is to add our possible work on this board, categorise and label it, and have conversations about how we’d start realising some of the outcomes. It helps us think about what we need to do next to learn about an opportunity and frames big bets against small bets. The hope is that it will make strategy and roadmap planning easier. Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been loads of chatter on Twitter about this new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-data-and-technology-functional-standard-version-1&quot;&gt;functional standard&lt;/a&gt; that GDS has published. I don’t really know what it is or what it’s for, so I’m going to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/07/02/launching-the-digital-data-and-technology-functional-standard/&quot;&gt;the blog post about it&lt;/a&gt;. Simon raised a good point that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simoneverest/status/1278980459117019136&quot;&gt;the pile-on from the old guard was a bit snarky&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m hoping they’ll add more detailed responses as comments on the blog post. The Strategy team did say they would review feedback, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reforge post in the reading list below is 🔥 by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re heading back to London this weekend, so moods are up and down. Not just at the prospect of having to spend 6 hours in the car, but also because, well, we’ve grown to love it here. And though I do love where we are in New Cross, there have been numerous benefits to living here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No commute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not woken up by sirens, ever&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t need to wear earplugs at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mountains to walk in are right there! &lt;em&gt;points&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some mornings I can smell the sea on the air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being close to friends has been a bummer, but like most other folk we’ve filled in that social gap with video calls and virtual pubs and tabletop RPGs. In a way, we’ve just been nudged towards things we could have been mostly doing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t wait to get back and have a mix though. Good thing about lockdown: I’ve started buying records&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; again. Mad to think that I would gladly spend £20 a week on records in 2007–10 but in recent years I’ve been like, ‘Hmm, is £2 on that digital single sensible?’ No more of that. Getting back into mixing and splashing out on music. Making more time to enjoy music without Spotify. Roll da bass!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll actually be able to update my website too. Because I left my main machine at home I’ve been writing these weeknotes on a Google Doc, so expect a flurry of posts when I get back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Emancipation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Took a week off work, as we’ve spent the majority of the year inside, working for The Man. I did attend one work-related thing, a webinar on Open Banking and other open innovation opportunities, but for most of the week I just did what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s some notes of joy from my week off. Mostly about food, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gathered fronds of gutweed – a common seaweed – and gobbled it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silky Caesar salad, minus the chicken, was just enough for dinner on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa Overdrive&lt;/em&gt; and needing a break from cyberspace, I started reading Raymond Williams’s &lt;em&gt;Border Country&lt;/em&gt;, a story about class, social mobility, and a London academic moving back to live in rural Wales. It’s delightfully pastoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fish shop had mussels, so lunch on Wednesday was &lt;em&gt;moules marinière&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went swimming in the sea and two dolphins crested the waves in front of us. Then we drank red wine as the sun set on the beach. And, back home, we ate Buffalo wings sloppily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Thursday’s scorching heat, we went walking near Nant Gwrtheryn. Down a steep valley beneath Yr Eifl to a pebbled beach with cool, azure sea. We then traipsed back to the car up a steep-sided hill, through an ancient oak woodland called &lt;a href=&quot;https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/local/gallt-y-bwlch-gwynedd&quot;&gt;Gallt y Bwlch&lt;/a&gt;, where I saw a gnarled oak. There was still some wild garlic clinging to the mountain stream, which we collected for dinner (barbecued mackerel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the rest of the week we just chilled. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Isolation 11</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a short series, as I usually keep series tied to the start of a quarter but quarters didn’t really happen on GOV.UK over the last 6 months. We didn’t have &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/06/gov-uks-firebreak-why-and-how-we-spent-a-month-working-differently/&quot;&gt;firebreaks&lt;/a&gt;, we didn’t take breathers really. There’s more structure to working on GOV.UK Pay, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I met with the other leads to talk about how our roadmap is shaping up for Q2. Last week, the teams scored possible work based on our confidence in delivering it, how long we suspected it would take, and whether we knew it was valuable for users. We came out with two big unknowns that needed discovery, a big push on one particular payment type, a cluster of middle-value work, and four month-long improvements to a domain of the platform. The aim in Tuesday’s meeting was to pick some work to take forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, the team had worked on developing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amplitude.com/north-star&quot;&gt;North Star metric&lt;/a&gt; and accompanying indicators, but they hadn’t yet had chance to use it to influence roadmapping and planning. After a lengthy conversation over the framework and its purpose, I asked whether we could put numbers against any of the measures, but we hadn’t yet taken readings. That’s understandable, everyone has been really busy, so now is a good time to take those readings and embed the framework in our day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also chatted about finding out what our users need. That’s worked out really well for me in the past, and I used Intercom’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/blog/where-do-you-suck-where-does-it-matter/&quot;&gt;Where do we suck? Where does it matter?&lt;/a&gt; framework to take readings of what users need. And that’s why we work in product: we’re guided by users’ needs, not the project we can do now with this many people for this amount of time. It’s not about using your roadmap like a Tetris board, slotting things in perfectly to suit your resources, it’s about delivering incremental value over time and reaching goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We regrouped on Thursday and decided that we’d split into two multidisciplinary teams: one focusing on paying users, the other looking at service teams. They’re plenty of opportunities around our admin tools and the team is in a good flow state, meaning the paying users team can ramp up as we onboard new team members. (I’m assuming I’m going to be looking after the paying users team!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting on Tuesday felt tense but by Thursday we were laughing and joking as we chatted through the next quarter. That shows we’re gelling as a unit, and proves how &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; it is to pick up on vibe when working remote. It’s not damaging us though, which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dgheath21&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;, our lead developer, chatted with me about making operational improvements to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note: David’s actually a bit of a legend and I’m &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; glad I get to work with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like there’s a heap of good practices already, just that some improvement work hasn’t made it through a team’s kanban board. I wonder whether we’re trying to map enterprise processes onto a small product team. Not sure on that one, will need to reach out to some 20-person SaaS businesses, ask how they handle tech debt and operational things. (It feels like this falls between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager#product-manager&quot;&gt;operational management expected of product managers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-developer#lead-developer&quot;&gt;availability and capacity management of lead developers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly like others, I’m really doing very little outside of work! Welsh lessons are progressing and I’m finding it easier to read and speak Welsh words, my mouth is learning the shapes it has to take to make the sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couch to 5K is fun, I do enjoy getting out and expending a bit of energy. I will need orthotics for my incredibly flat feet, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m taking the next week off, to read and have time away from my computer. It’s meant to be glorious so we might have a day at the beach, before the tourists come flooding back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as they arrive, we’ll be making our way back to London. We need to head back to the Big Smoke and pack up our flat, cancel our tenancy. Going to live in North Wales from September onwards, save some cash, avoid the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an all-team retro this week in which we talked about remote working, team dynamics and how often we’d like to be in the office when we return. I’ve always wanted to try full-on remote working, so coronavirus has provided that opportunity. But it has shown me that my product management style is one that is energised and sustained on a proximity to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so much a leader, maybe more of a hypeman. A workplace Bez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I am working on teams that don’t need a product manager, in my opinion, and I’ll say now that I don’t think you should have product teams solely dedicated to technical improvement work. And because they’re related, I don’t think you can have a constant morass of mission teams working hecticly on building things for the sake of building things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, working on GOV.UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/03/27/why-we-created-a-platform-health-team-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;Platform Health&lt;/a&gt; team was really fun and I think we did well to engage people in maintenance work – which is often uncelebrated and not very well respected compared to user-facing work – but it means that people throw work over the fence, expecting someone else to sort it out. A better model, I feel, is one that causes teams to take ownership of maintenance. We did that on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/05/making-site-search-work-smarter-for-users/&quot;&gt;Search team&lt;/a&gt;, committing 20 per cent of sprint work to platform health and technical debt, improving the technical stack and making user-facing feature work more sustainable. Product work and delivering outcomes, not project work and delivering outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which takes me back to being a product hypeman. You can more effectively plaudit unsexy technical work when it’s shown to unblock the sexy feature work. Calling for teams to devote themselves to technical work isn’t a product manager’s job though, that’s the role that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-developer#lead-developer&quot;&gt;technical leaders&lt;/a&gt; fulfil. A PM’s domain ropes together tech, design and the business, we can’t exist in only one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosie, a content designer and anti-racist, ran a session on how to talk about race. The workshop was aimed mostly at white people to help us be better allies. Two hundred people attended, which is awesome! We covered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what whiteness is, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to be anti-racist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, quite frankly, an incredible display of leadership, leading people through a situation collaboratively, and a much stronger display of leadership than we’ve seen from the executive team on the subject of racism. She didn’t pay lip service to a problem, she created an environment in which we could all confront it, head-on. What a legend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note I made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking for granted or denying your white privilege is an act of oppression. You can’t turn it off, but you can leverage it. You can be white without signing on to whiteness. Calling for white culture to be the norm in Western culture, because it always has been, is whiteness. It’s white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke some more to the MPA students from UCL who are looking at personalisation. I was surprised to learn that they hadn’t had much engagement with GOV.UK’s senior management team or anyone else at GDS, they’d only had access to two policy managers and the Accounts team. They were also struggling to know what to do next, so I told them to focus on the unique view they can bring to the project: thinking through public value and how to be strategic with personalisation. It’s not about making things easier to find, it’s about making sure that users reach the outcomes they need to. Boring magic, not shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-things&quot;&gt;Not-work things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running has been going well. Dare I say it, I looked forward to it one morning this week. That’s probably due to the endorphins and how my body is a slave to stimuli, as I’m reducing my alcohol intake at the same time as exercising more. I’m toking on health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p087gj19/devs&quot;&gt;DEVS&lt;/a&gt; is a decent show, you should watch it. Alex Garland, the bloke who wrote the excellent &lt;em&gt;The Beach&lt;/em&gt;, has created a scintillating thriller about multiple universe theory, quantum computing and simulated reality. It’s v cool. Though a couple of the characters are quite flat, the plot carries it along and the story is a redeeming one. The soundtrack is fantastic too. Bingeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, I haven’t really done anything else, apart from continue to learn Welsh and play our Fate RPG. Might need to find an online community to be part of…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took an uneasy decision this week to pause the Direct Debit pilot on GOV.UK Pay. As a payment type we don’t yet offer a few of the features which make switching to Pay a viable option for service teams. And building out those features would eat up time and people we don’t have spare at the moment. So we’ll need to take stock and look at how we make it MVP in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why they call it minimum &lt;em&gt;viable&lt;/em&gt; product. You can’t just offer a small feature set, it needs to be good enough to work for users too. So, all in all, I think it was the right decision. We also met with our economist to work out whether Pay could survive by not offering Direct Debit, and we’re good for the next year, so we have some runway at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlight of the week was the Game Day, a chance to practice your response to incidents. Using tabletop roleplaying as the game mechanic, we split off into teams of ~6 people and were given a scenario. For example, there’s a new XSS vulnerability that can be invoked with the 💩 emoji. Then we start investigating, assigning roles according to our incident response procedure, and we work through the problem. When a developer needs to check something, like looking at logs, they message the game-master describing their action and the GM responds with the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really, really fun and gave me a chance to play the comms lead and escalation point roles, which I’m more likely to need to do at Pay. Turns out that apart from not really knowing exactly what to do, I did keep calm so that’s a plus. Really want to practice a few more times though, work up the muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I must be better at next week is planning out my daily work. I’ve got a Trello board full of actions I need to take, describing my work, and I haven’t been moving things through the board this week. I’m worried there’s stuff I’m saying I’ll do but haven’t recorded, so it goes undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning how things work and answering enquiries from users is helping with that. I thought about this when I joined GOV.UK but it seems sensible for all new PM recruits to spend time on user support in their first few months, to learn how everything works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented my work on personalisation to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/study/master-public-administration-mpa-innovation-public-policy-and-public-value&quot;&gt;UCL MPA for Innovation&lt;/a&gt; students that have joined GOV.UK to research personalisation. Coincidentally, some students from the course were talking to Pay in December/January and Katie passed me their details, so I dropped them a line to see if they were interested. GOV.UK SMT invited them in a few weeks ago, which is really good – this work needs academic rigour! They’re taking the angle of how personalisation can generate public value too, which is glorious to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were really inspired by the work, which was validating, and we’ve put in some more time to chat things through. I’m really interested in their course too, I do wonder what it could offer me. Moving to Pay is helping me get properly involved in disruptive innovation, I’m so happy about it! Maybe the course is a good place to continue that enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockdown life has taken its toll and my waistband is growing bigger. That ain’t good, so this week I started using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/one-you-couch-to-5k/id1082307672&quot;&gt;Couch to 5K&lt;/a&gt; from Public Health England (others exist but, come on, I’m a civil servant! I need to use that one). I’ve got flat feet so I overpronate when I run, and I’m a little worried about my joints and ankles, but there hasn’t been a problem so far. It’s a really good programme, so simple and I’m sleeping better as a result of the exercise. Let’s see if I’m ever able to run 5 kilometres non-stop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been using a high-intensity interval training app too, doing upper body strength exercises on the rest days from running. It gets your heart rate up but doesn’t burn too many calories, so I may need to combine upper body workouts with some full body sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that has been a good distraction from the fact the world is on fire. But it’s really hard to miss what’s happening in North Amerikkka. And to not acknowledge that the USA is structurally racist because of Britain would be ignoring the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a working class family, in the Industrial heartlands of the West Midlands, yet I’ve never had to struggle because of the colour of my skin. I’ve known racism but I’ve never been subject to it. My ascendancy hasn’t been as smooth as those more privileged than me, but it has been relatively easy compared to non-whites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also spent much of my life enjoying the products of West Indian and Afro-Caribbean cultures, specifically the branches that grew in Britain amid the din of racial hatred. Jungle, drum ‘n’ bass, house, garage, 2-step, grime, dubstep: British bass music is a direct descendant of Caribbean soundsystem culture, an arm of the Afrofuturist diaspora with a mission to overcome oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I owe a debt to the black community, having profited emotionally on the outputs of black culture. It is an indelible part of my identity. It is necessary for me to read the books and articles being suggested, I’ll increase my anti-racist efforts, and work out what more I need to do to support my peers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more work on Direct Debit this week. I don’t think you can spend 1.5 weeks on something and make a big strategic decision, so I broke the work down into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decisions we’d need to make immediately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evidence we’d need to collect to support long-term decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week’s strategy session also pointed to questions about GOV.UK Pay’s wider strategy too, which requires its own time to think through. I guess strategy is a living, breathing thing that you can’t think about at interspersed moments: you need to keep your eye on the strategy and whether you’re reaching your vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling bad that I haven’t had much time to dedicate to the Kaizen and Migration teams too, though needs must. I’m going to make sure that David and I chat about the operational running of GOV.UK Pay in detail over the next few weeks, so that we’re approaching Q2 with some clearly articulated objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that our team shapes will change, from one multidisciplinary team plus two tech teams to two multidisciplinary teams plus one migration team. Miriam has been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/dual-track-agile/&quot;&gt;dual-track agile&lt;/a&gt;, which I proposed for the Personalisation team, though we struggled to shift fully into build mode: most likely because we were finding our feet throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m heartened to see that much of the vision we stoked into the personalisation project has survived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/28/update-on-the-future-of-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;Jen’s latest blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not about increasing engagement, it’s about ensuring success the first time someone tries to do, find or know something. We’re not in the business of clocking up eyeball minutes, we want to help you get the thing you need so you can get on with your life. Boring magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22personalisation%22+site%3Avisitmy.website&quot;&gt;my time kicking off the exploration of personalising government&lt;/a&gt; on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really don’t have the same energy for weeknotes at the moment, so I’m going to read through my early notes to pick up some enthusiasm. Maybe it’s just that writing about work feels like a chore. There was a point earlier in the year when a friend asked how I separated my work self from myself – and we realised I didn’t, I invested my whole person in The Job. Adding more personal reflections has caused a useful separation though. That’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading &lt;em&gt;Count Zero&lt;/em&gt;. Found it preferable to &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, the prequel, as there’s much less shifting about scenes at a rapid pace, instead spending time building moods and tension. The intertwining of the stories is done well, though I did lose track of Turner (one of the characters). And this book really shows you how much Gibson’s Sprawl trilogy had an influence on &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, the Wachowskis took plenty of inspiration from these books. Looking forward to starting &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa Overdrive&lt;/em&gt; next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The riots in the US are worrying, uncomfortably similar to the 2011 riots in the UK. Seems like as good a time as any to check your privilege.

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of my focus this week was spent on Direct Debit. GOV.UK Pay has planned to develop and launch Direct Debit as a payment type for some time, and there’s a pilot version being used by one service now. However, due to a complication with issuing service user numbers to central government departments and arms-length bodies, we’re having to rethink the strategy a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the work, I had to estimate how many heavy goods vehicles might pass through a city zone each year, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1263824177330610177&quot;&gt;took some digging to find the numbers&lt;/a&gt;. In the end though, I was able to estimate that about 50,000 HGVs pass through a Clean Air Zone in Leeds each year, which was helpful for the strategy piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ran a 2-hour strategy workshop using some techniques and tools I picked up from the IDEO course. Ideally you should spend a week working through the exercises with a team, but I condensed it down into a couple of hours. I think the session was helpful in working through the problem, but 2 hours definitely wasn’t long enough as you didn’t have a chance to step back and consider things holistically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I’ll be drumming up some evidence to help us make a decision on what to do about Direct Debit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Muslim network at GDS held a fast-a-thon, encouraging non-Muslims to join in with Ramadan by fasting for a day. Since I’ve always been around classmates and colleagues who are fasting but have never given it a go, I figured I’d try it. Though I was tired in the afternoon, the pangs of hunger I was expecting didn’t hit me. But I found myself appreciating my evening meal even more. There’s a blog post about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;Digital People blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m quickly finishing these notes off on the bank holiday Monday and the weekend has been filled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52779356&quot;&gt;a particular news story&lt;/a&gt;. For the record, we weren’t symptomatic when we arrived in North Wales and we quarantined ourselves for two weeks on arrival. We’re here to help others, not be helped. And we definitely didn’t visit a local tourist spot during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw some porpoises and seals in the bay yesterday, it was wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dgheath21&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;, our lead developer, gave me an overview of the technical architecture for GOV.UK Pay, which is really handy. It’s such an interesting platform, really makes it easy for teams and organisations to start taking payments (in 60 seconds flat!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was spent preparing a session to work out some strategic problems and plot some possibilities for overcoming those barriers, using techniques I learned in the IDEO course. And, you know what, I even started to enjoy my job again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s sad to admit it, but I really lost the spark and enthusiasm for my job in September last year. I used to jump out of bed in the morning, ready for the day, as dorky as that sounds. So I’m glad that feeling is starting to come back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amplitude.com/blog/introducing-north-star-playbook&quot;&gt;North Star framework&lt;/a&gt; put together by John Cutler at Amplitude. Our North Star is ‘Number of healthy integrations’ which is a clear measure and aims for sustainable growth. The KPIs that make up the North Star are good too, decent key results for the teams for focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading &lt;em&gt;Ghost Hardware&lt;/em&gt;, though it is quite short. Three chapters, distinctly 2011 in feeling: a raid on a sports shop organised over social media, digital art, and toxic wastelands. Heading back to start &lt;em&gt;Count Zero&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Played our first game of Fate, the first tabletop RPG I’ve ever played, and it was great! Took a few turns to get into the swing of things, to realise that we could lead the story as much as the gamemaster, but it’s super fun. Can’t believe we didn’t play this at uni when we were studying creative writing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Isolation 5</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got started on GOV.UK Pay this week. I met the teams and started settling into life as a product manager on the Government-as-a-Platform (GaaP) programme. Already I can see how much I’m going to enjoy it! Everyone’s really skilled and passionate about the product, which makes it easier, and they’ve put considerable effort into making everything understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought it would be tough engaging with the new team. You can’t rely on body language or sitting next to people, so you lose half the soft skills we frequently rely on in product management. But it hasn’t mattered one bit. I’ve found that 30-minute video calls have been polite and intimate, and I’ve had to focus on clear language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really helped me start getting my feet under the table was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rossferg/status/960974335002468353&quot;&gt;product manager induction Trello board that Ross created&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. I iterated it slightly, which made it a little more effective so I’ll write a blog post about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on two teams: one focusing on migrating to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;Platform as a Service&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen&quot;&gt;kaizen&lt;/a&gt; team focusing on continually improving the product and our processes. For strategy work, I’m looking at Direct Debits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we’ll try some team sessions, to gather people’s thoughts and collaborate on setting objectives. It’ll be different, for sure, but with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies'/quotes/symbol/the-conch/&quot;&gt;conch system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVZPh8Zz8lw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;jamboards&lt;/a&gt;, I reckon we’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s Show &amp;amp; Tell was so good, packed with really excellent work. Thinking back, I don’t think I’d ever read a weeknote from Pay, so I asked if we could put one together. It’s really important that GaaP products and their successes stay on the executive team’s radar, so that solving common problems across government remains the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My notebook is packed full of scribblings that I need to turn into sensible notes or things to do. Probably need to take a few hours on Sunday to work through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TfL and the BBC have released some virtual backgrounds for your Zoom calls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://londonblog.tfl.gov.uk/2020/05/01/video-conference-backgrounds/&quot;&gt;scenes on London transport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/empty_sets_collection/zfvy382&quot;&gt;empty sets from TV shows&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a really neat touch from the public service orgs. I wondered what a GDS virtual background might be: maybe just a bunch of Post-its on the wall of some hallowed Cabinet Office room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contact tracing app has got everyone talking about privacy, interoperability and centralised vs decentralised data models, which is really good. Apple and Google proposed and built decentralised models distinctly because they’ve been criticised for their approach to privacy before, and I’m surprised that the government doesn’t just follow the tech giants – they’ve got way more resources to test these approaches out. So it makes me angry to read that money is being spent on creating a second contact tracing app with a decentralised model, ‘in case politicians decide to make a switch’. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahtgold/status/1258676392620888067&quot;&gt;some of the data permissions patterns are being figured out by NHS&lt;/a&gt; rather than GDS, which is good to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our world and the characters we’re creating in our Fate Core game are coming along really well, and I think we’ll play our first session this weekend. Perhaps predictably, we’ve come up with a dystopian cyberpunk future world with a hacker, a cybernetic prosthetics engineer and a cargo ship pilot. Who cares though, it’s just a bit of fun! Looking forward to hanging out in Axiom more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing &lt;em&gt;Microserfs&lt;/em&gt;, I bought &lt;em&gt;Count Zero&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson, the sequel to_Neuromancer_. Although I had to stop reading it two chapters in because my pre-order of &lt;em&gt;Ghost Hardware&lt;/em&gt; by Tim Maugham came through. So after a brief stint in Bristol, suffused with sub-bass, I’ll return to New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up some gems on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser&quot;&gt;Bandcamp Day&lt;/a&gt;, buying some of the albums I liked most from last year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sneakersocialclub.bandcamp.com/album/halcyon-daze&quot;&gt;Soundbwoy Killah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whities.bandcamp.com/album/whities-019&quot;&gt;Overmono&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/itlp04-skee-mask-compro&quot;&gt;Skee Mask&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://punchdrunkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ashley-road-sessions-88-94&quot;&gt;Smith &amp;amp; Mighty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://leegamble.bandcamp.com/album/diversions-1994-1996&quot;&gt;Lee Gamble&lt;/a&gt; all got some £££s. Bandcamp is one of the best ways to support the musicians you love, and right now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3640&quot;&gt;scene needs saving&lt;/a&gt;. Why not buy a record or two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cat loves watching the swallows fly around in the morning. I’ve taken to watching them with him. Much better than watching the buses go to bed at New Cross bus garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They reckon No. 10 will announce changes to the lockdown on Sunday, although it’s worth mentioning that the changes will possibly only apply in England. I’m worried that the country will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/07/no-10-scrambles-to-control-amid-fierce-criticism-of-lockdown-mixed-messages&quot;&gt;misinterpret the message&lt;/a&gt; or only hear what they want to hear, meaning the R number could rise over the next two to three weeks. So we’ll stay in Wales for the rest of May. &lt;em&gt;EDIT: About 2 hours after I wrote this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-52308604&quot;&gt;the First Minister extended the lockdown by 3 weeks&lt;/a&gt; anyway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnwelsh.cymru&quot;&gt;learning Welsh&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, so that’s convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Isolation 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These notes cover a few weeks, rather than one week like usual. Writing weeknotes in the pandemic just didn’t feel necessary over the last few weeks, getting my head out of work was a higher priority. Having said that, there’s a few things worth noting from the last five weeks of lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-learned-working-on-end-to-end-services&quot;&gt;Things I learned working on end-to-end services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent 6 weeks working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable&quot;&gt;extremely vulnerable people service&lt;/a&gt;, a cross-government effort to get food and support to people with a specific medical condition or who have been told to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#staying-at-home-and-shielding&quot;&gt;‘shield’&lt;/a&gt; by their GP. When the service is successful, pockets of the country will stay at home, therefore reducing the number of people who are likely to be infected, are likely to need hospital attention, and are likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extremely vulnerable people service is an end-to-end service delivered by multiple departments and a few third-party organisations. For those that don’t know, end-to-end services begin from the point where the user starts trying to achieve a goal to the point when they’re finished. This includes website content, the transactional part of the service, the phone, post and face-to-face channels, as well as the digital elements. And it includes the internal processes that government needs to deliver an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few things we noticed would be helpful in building and iterating those kinds of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progress – even if it’s not perfect – is better than stasis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build consensus for solutions with evidence, and reduce risk together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define success criteria early: how you’ll know if you’re meeting users’ needs or not&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outcomes are the glue that hold departments together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A shared understanding of the problem is ideal, but shared sympathy for the impact is better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A shared backlog makes interoperability possible for teams from different organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the service, end-to-end, with a small group and iterate as it grows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operations and logistics processes are harder to change than websites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users sometimes don’t read things, so you can’t fix failure demand with a content change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speak up if you’re having a hard time, because someone else probably is too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Other work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two-and-a-bit years working on GOV.UK, I’m moving over to work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; and I’m super excited. After picking out a few skills to work on in my end-of-year conversation about professional development, it seems like GOV.UK Pay will be a really good place to double-down on user focus, strategic ownership and financial ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GOV.UK product managers gave me a lovely send-off and Martin put together a Jamboard where people could share memories of working with me. It was really thoughtful and touching, I’m going to miss them lots. Being remote means there’s less chance of catching people in the hallway, so I must remember to drop in on them occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pr0bablyfine&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; and I met with the Head of Comms to chat about weeknotes. They’re supportive of people writing about work provided they follow the Civil Service Code and don’t use personal channels as government outlets. That’s fair enough really. Anyway, they gave both our blogs the thumbs-up and said we neutered things well, so I’ll share the principles I follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we wound-down the personalisation work, we wanted to focus on design principles for privacy, transparency and re-use of data. It would help make the personalisation proposition understandable, accountable and trustable for users. We were going to use primary and secondary research as a method for finding the edges. No one across government is looking at this (as far as we know) and as GOV.UK is the platform in the centre, we’re best-placed to represent users across the board. I’m looking forward to seeing someone pick up the baton and run with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 8 years of transforming public services digitally has been about the &lt;em&gt;interaction&lt;/em&gt; between citizen and state, but ‘personalising’ that means we need to invest in the &lt;em&gt;conversation&lt;/em&gt; between citizen and state too. That’s how you make it feel personalised. That’s where the innovation lies. Create &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/08/boring-magic/&quot;&gt;boring magic&lt;/a&gt;, not shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Public services, funded by public money, must be open to public scrutiny – especially in times of great upheaval when lots of decisions are being made very quickly.’ Rachel Coldicutt&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being quarantined for long periods of time hasn’t bothered me much. I was hyper-online as a teenager, spending most evenings and weekends cooped-up in my bedroom on the computer. Coding websites, surfing the web, hacking, playing Counter-Strike. Sedentary and isolated. And now it’s mandated by the government! (Shout-out to all the parents merging home life with work life, though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a secret post and, as far as I know, no one read it. 👋 to the three people who read my second secret post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom pub quizzes are quite good, aren’t they? Highlights included bonus points when Danny Dyer popped up randomly, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_clash&quot;&gt;sound clash&lt;/a&gt;, and imitating famous paintings. Actually, Zoom pub quizzes might be better than pub quizzes…though I do miss the pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;em&gt;Microserfs&lt;/em&gt; by Doug Coupland, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattinwales&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; recommended to me. First thought: wow, working in tech hasn’t changed much, has it?! It’s an enjoyable postmodern read, focusing on the growth of the characters as they transition from introverted code-monkeys to fully featured personalities. The comparison between Apple and Microsoft cultures was funny too, you could write that book now and make it about GDS and NHS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carried on playing old PlayStation games. Tomb Raider is really quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other gaming news, I’m starting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/basics&quot;&gt;Fate Core&lt;/a&gt; RPG with my best mates. I’ve never played a tabletop RPG before, I figured they all involved fantasy in some shape or form, but Fate allows you to design the world and characters any way you want. As two of the crew are in Montreal and Vancouver, the rest of us in Britain, we’re using Discord for text and voice chat. I might start writing notes on our games &lt;a href=&quot;https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk&quot;&gt;like Michael does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the last five weeks living in North Wales, helping my partner’s brother deliver food and supplies to elderly and infirm relatives. We’ve spent the entire time physically distancing from family, making sure that if any of us became infected we wouldn’t transmit it to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has given us a chance to road-test living here, as I don’t want to be in London for ever and it’s closer to my parents than Bristol or Cardiff. I’ve always wanted to live in Wales, ever since I was a boy, as we holidayed in Llandudno most years. I think we could make it work, as long as remote working will become part of the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been supporting to local economy wherever possible, buying excess beer from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwrwllyn.cymru&quot;&gt;Cwrw Llŷn&lt;/a&gt;, coffee from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pobladocoffi.co.uk&quot;&gt;Poblado&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables and eggs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://treddafyddorganic.co.uk&quot;&gt;Treddafydd&lt;/a&gt;, pizza from &lt;a href=&quot;http://crust.wales&quot;&gt;Crust&lt;/a&gt;, cakes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twoislandsicecream.co.uk&quot;&gt;Two Islands&lt;/a&gt;, fish from &lt;a href=&quot;http://llynseafoods.com&quot;&gt;Pysgod Llŷn&lt;/a&gt; and meat from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pwllhelibutchers.cymru&quot;&gt;cigyddion&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a delicious two weeks, the produce here is excellent. Though I do miss hauling seasonal produce back home from Brockley Market each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth saying though: we’re really privileged to be here and others don’t have this opportunity. So I’m taking nothing for granted. I hope you and your loved ones pull through this weird time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’s coverage of coronavirus has been so good, and their writing about the food industry is fantastic. Definitely worth the &lt;a href=&quot;nytimes.com/share/1jnA6Be&quot;&gt;50p per week subscription&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This week I’ve been working with an incredible team of people, who spent an entire weekend building a service to deliver food to people who need it most during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51997151&quot;&gt;shielding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though they spent long hours spinning up a service that would have otherwise taken weeks to design and build (including the logistics side), everyone put their back into ensuring the service was reliable, available and meeting user needs all week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And when user feedback started flooding in (over 10,000 items in 4 days), they reviewed it and spotted an opportunity to pivot to solving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/map-a-users-whole-problem&quot;&gt;whole problem&lt;/a&gt;. I work with some fucking heroes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s my job to be the shit umbrella, giving them the space to do that. So this week has mostly been about stakeholder management, concise communication, joining the organisational dots, and pitching in on performance analysis and user support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve learned a lot – as I’m sure many people have – about what happens when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/8451589322&quot;&gt;the nucleus of work&lt;/a&gt; is distributed, what happens when the senior responsible owner is a network not an individual, and what viable systems of organisation in joined-up digital government might be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s probably a good time to check notes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/26/what-weve-learnt-about-scaling-agile/&quot;&gt;scaling agile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yesterday I left the house for the first time in two weeks. We went to Sainsbury’s for supplies and it was very weird. Some shelves were empty, products I hadn’t seen before replaced the usual brands, and the tannoy kept addressing us to take only three of any item. It felt like the apocalypse was happening slowly – which it is, of course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyway, I haven’t really done anything this week except work. Downtime has been watching telly or reading, which isn’t sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oh wait, I did defrost the freezer for something to do. And started a sourdough culture, like everyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’d like to write about coronavirus’s effect on the food supply chain. It feels like there could be a tipping point soon, where it’s more viable for supermarkets to meet home-delivery demand by sourcing local suppliers. Not only will international suppliers become more expensive, their output will likely drop too, pushing prices up and making local suppliers more competitive. But even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farmdrop.com/blog/were-all-in-this-together/&quot;&gt;Farmdrop is operating at capacity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We had a Zoom birthday party for a friend. It felt like being inside and outside Hogarth’s Britain, simultaneously being involved in and observing each painting all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going to play more Metal Gear Solid this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was getting sad about not being able to eat wild garlic this year, but we managed to pilfer a hefty bag of the stuff for dinner. CAN’T WAIT!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Isolation 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Work-related notes have returned! That should excite some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncommon times we’re living in, but extraordinary efforts are being undertaken. Shout-out to all the public service heroes working on coronavirus projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-stuff&quot;&gt;Work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missions have been paused so that we can work on urgent projects related to coronavirus. My colleagues have already delivered some excellent products and services, all delivered quickly to an emerging need. You can see most of them at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus&quot;&gt;www.gov.uk/coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; (which is very good in itself).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve been lending support to Public Health England and NHSX on a new version of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-track-coronavirus-cases&quot;&gt;public-facing dashboard and open data&lt;/a&gt; tracking coronavirus in the UK. They’ve created some &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/national-indicator-library&quot;&gt;national indicators&lt;/a&gt; in a very short space of time which deserves credit. But as with all statistics, there’s &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; going on behind the scenes to ensure the numbers are up-to-date, accurate, and reliable. It makes your head spin to think of it all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve been using much of the knowledge on statistics and data I picked up at &lt;a href=&quot;https://porism.com&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt; working on LG Inform and LG Inform Plus, which has helped me get up-to-speed on things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However, it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121211-00/?p=5863&quot;&gt;v-team&lt;/a&gt; effort with team members distributed across different organisations with different priorities, so I’ve found it tough being their delivery manager who’s not close to the decision-makers and senior stakeholders. It has really made me think about how much &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1242056957755830272&quot;&gt;we take agile ways of working for granted&lt;/a&gt; at GDS – encouraging others to work that way and see the value is so tough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And while I was typing these notes, I was asked to start working on something else, so I’m switching back into product mode…NOW!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any spare time I had from coordinating the dashboard team was used to work on the strategy course I’m doing through IDEO U, which I’m still loving. I’d like to apply what I’m learning to GOV.UK’s current and future strategies, but we’re hiring a Strategy Lead so it’s possibly not considered a product responsibility any more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-stuff&quot;&gt;Not-work stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinstalled &lt;a href=&quot;https://retropie.org.uk&quot;&gt;Retropie&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday and started playing &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt;, which used to make me super nervous as a kid, but I’m really enjoying playing as an adult. Don’t know if it’s the glow of nostalgia around the game but the story cocoons you, like watching &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I watched hours of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/programmes/b0667qf6&quot;&gt;Rick Stein on iPlayer&lt;/a&gt;, whom I love. He might actually be my hero. Travel, culture, and food all wrapped up. It’s the perfect escapism right now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sun came out on Sunday and looks set to be about all week, so the hammock is set-up in the garden. I got a sun burn. HELLO, SPRING.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking forward to spring vegetables making an appearance at the market. Living on carrots, parsnips, celeriac, kale, broccoli, potatoes, beetroot, jerusalem artichokes and other winter veg for the last 3–4 months has really pushed our creative talents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which reminds me, I need to finish that piece about seasonal British produce I started writing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only one more week of isolation to go.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Isolation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Again, these are personal weeknotes. I know most of you come here for the work tidbits, so sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being locked up for 3 days was quite hard, so by Saturday (7th) I really wanted to get out of the house. The problem was that coincided with my body’s excessive mucus production, making it hard to hide the fact I was ill in public. By chance, I happened to find the perfect cover: spicy phở. Everyone sniffs and coughs when eating hot, spicy soup. (Does you good too.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wandered down alongside the Thames. I love it there and used to walk it a lot when I lived close to &lt;a href=&quot;https://boroughphotos.org/lewisham/st-nicholas-church-deptford-47/&quot;&gt;St Nicholas church in Deptford&lt;/a&gt;. Never often made it past the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cuttysarkse10.co.uk&quot;&gt;Cutty Sark pub&lt;/a&gt;, though, and I’ve been missing out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The highlight was Richard Wilson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Slice_of_Reality&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Slice of Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially eerie because a radio was playing inside the ship, though I could have sworn that no one was aboard. It reminded me of passages in &lt;em&gt;Doggerland&lt;/em&gt;, the book I was reading a few weeks ago.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not fancying reading more of &lt;em&gt;Lean UX&lt;/em&gt; on a Sunday, I hunted out a podcast about naval history but couldn’t find anything to suit. So instead I tried to find one about Greenwich’s naval history. There was a 30-minute show on BBC Sounds but nothing else. It mentioned Samuel Pepys though, and I remembered I hadn’t read his diary yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyway, I’m now 330-odd chapters through the audiobook. I’m still quite surprised that his diary is where I ended up after seeking out a podcast about Britain’s adventures on the sea, but low and behold he’s actually on a ship now. So maybe it was the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mad to think that there wasn’t really a ruling monarch in 1660. Looking forward to hearing how he deals with the plague too, as people have already made comparisons between that and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cyz0z8w0ydwt/coronavirus-outbreak&quot;&gt;our own epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My new speakers arrived on Friday (6th) and I’ve been enjoying them an awful lot. Much more fidelty, the frequencies are treated properly, and there’s elements to songs I hadn’t picked up on before.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monday evening (9th) served up a treat: Ashley Henry live-scored scenes from space at the Royal Observatory. They called it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmg.co.uk/see-do/exhibitions-events/space-jams-royal-observatory-feat-ashley-henry-live-scored-planetarium-experience&quot;&gt;‘space jams’&lt;/a&gt;. It was a new experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot, though at times the visuals weren’t quantised with the music. Maybe it’d work better if the music were properly arranged rather than improvised.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I booked tickets for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1399212&quot;&gt;Livity Sound at Mick’s Garage&lt;/a&gt; but it’ll probably get cancelled…which is a shame as Peverelist B2B Pinch is just 😙👌&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went to see Moses Boyd at Electric Brixton on Thursday (12th), and I dunno if I’ve &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; seen a drummer lead a band like that. Also, I don’t know if it’s fair to call him a jazz musician, feels like it boxes him in too much. Yes, it’s inspired by jazz but he plays with influences from electronic music so much. The lighting was rad too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fell into an internet hole looking at the history of civil defence in the UK. It’s quite amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Renovation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reducing the amount of time I spend thinking about work outside of work is having its benefits, so I’m only gonna chat about ‘personal things’. My mental health is improving by working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; is a bit good, eh? The way Bong Joon Ho seamlessly stitched together different genres and moods throughout the story was masterful. After chatting to a friend who lived in South Korea for a while, I learned that it’s a fairly common storytelling technique in their culture: extraordinary stories in common settings. I think that’s why it worked so well. (I preferred &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/parasite-review.html&quot;&gt;the NY Times review&lt;/a&gt; to the Guardian’s.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went to see &lt;em&gt;1917&lt;/em&gt; the following week too, which is emotive and gut-wrenching and shocking all in one. People who’ve played &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; will get it immediately. Maybe avoid it if you’re stressed out though, it’ll have your veins pumped full of cortisol in no time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only other single-track film I’ve seen is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4226388/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victoria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I caught a trailer for a few years ago and saw on a whim. It turned out to be one of the best films I’ve ever seen, possibly knocking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117407/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pusher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; off the top spot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re a GDS person, watch this documentary about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00t3f42/ours-to-keep-incomers&quot;&gt;Spitalfields’ decaying Georgian houses&lt;/a&gt; and the 1980s effort to restore them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bass, Mids, Tops&lt;/em&gt; continues to deliver on providing me with new sounds to listen to. I’ve been enjoying Adrian Sherwood’s repertoire and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://on-usound.com&quot;&gt;On-U Sound label&lt;/a&gt;. Dubby, playful with music tech, celebratory of soundsystem culture. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://onusound.bleepstores.com/artist/45578-doctor-pablo-the-dub-syndicate&quot;&gt;Doctor Pablo&lt;/a&gt; stuff is cracking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a result, there’s a few dub tracks in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1In4kMSguQDCi7UVam8J88?si=Bh_MqGZHQ4mV3NfJFv151g&amp;amp;_php=1&quot;&gt;February playlist&lt;/a&gt;, alongside new British jazz supremo Moses Boyd, a new Legowelt, Ashley Henry and a fuzzy, blues number.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve been re-reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanuxbook.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lean UX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to give me a boost at work, and that’s been really helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ideou.com/products/designing-strategy&quot;&gt;designing strategy course&lt;/a&gt; from IDEO last week, it’s so good. Not too dissimilar to Lean methods, to be honest, but I slightly different framework to suit any business context, not just digital products. Loving it so far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krksys.com&quot;&gt;KRKs&lt;/a&gt;, which I’ve been meaning to do for like 12 years. Can’t wait to hear tunes through those speakers!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking about the below quote from Andrew Weatherall, maybe weeknotes are good for sharing but not for active thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We live in a world where every minute is documented, so there’s not so much room to mythologise anything.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Despite that, and in response to the quote below, I am going to say that the resurgence of rave culture is more about fashion than an actual backlash against the times we live in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After years of fragmentation and polarisation, the joyful militancy of early rave feels poignant; the kind of unified response to political strife that this era is yet to produce.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to redesign this website soon: get rid of the Javascript, make it accessible, learn Sass so that I can actually tweak the frontend. I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll&quot;&gt;Barber&lt;/a&gt; as the theme currently but feel like making my own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since we’re on the cusp of an epidemic and I’ve got a bad cold, I’m isolating myself at home. Prevents other people catching it, but also tension and paranoia abounds on public transport. The slightest sniffle and people are alarmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How we use clinics for product problems at GOV.UK</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a product manager can often feel like being a lone wolf. Despite working closely with a team of designers, developers and other digital specialists, you’re usually the only member of the group representing the product discipline. So who can you turn to for advice or help solving a product problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/communities-of-practice-agile-organisation/&quot;&gt;Communities of practice&lt;/a&gt; are a good remedy, loose structures that support people doing the same job to come together and help each other. The product community at GOV.UK, where I work, meet every Tuesday to talk about our practice, and a little while ago we ran a workshop to look at better ways to support our fellow product managers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea that came out was the product clinic: a safe place to bring forward your product problems and receive knowledge, experience, emotional, social or practical help from your peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A product manager has a problem (or a few)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They raise it with a panel of 2–4 product managers they work with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The panel steps into the PM’s shoes, responding on how they’d approach the situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty simple, there’s not that much structure. Topics can range from soft skills to strategy to tools, anything related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager#introduction-to-the-role-of-product-manager&quot;&gt;a product manager’s role&lt;/a&gt;. All you need is a time and place to meet, some problems to solve, and a group of empathetic peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; you need a culture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://conradfrancis.com/vulnerability-and-openness-to-grow/&quot;&gt;openness and vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in which people are comfortable opening up. (But if your community are willing to support each other, it likely already exists.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take notes during my clinic sessions, so that I can refer back to them later. I’ll keep a list of those here because other people might find my colleagues’ suggestions helpful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s better to get things out of your head rather than suffer in silence. If you’re struggling with a product problem at work, why not consider starting a clinic with your fellow product managers?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-from-clinic-sessions&quot;&gt;Notes from clinic sessions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m in the process of writing these up, check back later or subscribe to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website/feed.xml&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you deal with disputes with your boss? (Soft skills)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if the strategy seems confused and unclear? (Product strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you frame assumptions to be validated or invalidated? (Teams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Blog post coming soon on &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk&quot;&gt;Inside GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to Laura ran the workshop. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1214618166183153664&quot;&gt;output of the workshop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I reckon all digital practitioners could benefit from clinics, not only product managers. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Black Dog and the Storm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a bad time with the old mental health, at the moment, so I’m going to stop reflecting on work for a bit. A better divide between work and me-as-a-person will hopefully give my mood more buoyancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had fun with Data Club last Tuesday, and I really liked that Simon came along. The pub was rather loud but we were still able to have good conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Ben-Smith/Doggerland/22392560&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doggerland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A decent book. It’s about two men – referred to as ‘the Old Man’ and ‘the Boy’ throughout, except for two moments their names are mentioned – who live on a windfarm in the southern North Sea, in a sombre dystopia. They live off canned protein and fruit, fix wind turbines, and generally don’t like each other. The Old Man dredges up artefacts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006707&quot;&gt;Doggerland&lt;/a&gt;; the Boy obsesses over fixing things. It paints their aching boredom quite vividly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At uni, I had to write 5,000 words (and the plot) of a novel, and &lt;em&gt;Doggerland&lt;/em&gt;’s tone was similar to my book. I should dig out the manuscript.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not yet done with reading stories set in the sea, I picked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://granta.com/products/cove/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cove&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Cynan Jones, finishing it in a couple of hours. Cracking little short story about a man pitting himself against pain, riding his instinct to stay alive. There’s a theme developing from the stories I’m reading…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Really enjoying GoJauntly at the moment. It was always good but has improved immensely since they added the map with footpaths and bridleways detailed. Means you can create and adapt walks easily. (I suspect it’s just a stepping stone towards becoming an OS map collector, though.) Here’s a walk I did between &lt;a href=&quot;https://gojauntly.app.link/TybSHVGQ43?_p=c91129c39c077af1e11d90faea&quot;&gt;Llanbedrog and Abersoch beach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Public Service Velodrome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of my week was taken up by preparing a presentation/sales pitch for a Very Important Person, so I didn’t get much time to spend with the team. Here’s some bullet points on what I did anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduced a new product manager to the community by becoming their buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offered to help out an associate product manager by having them shadow me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had some productive chats with the team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another session with Rob and the other PMs was helpful in breaking down the future strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had a good coffee with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Na7hanGood&quot;&gt;Nathan&lt;/a&gt;, and a great response to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1224765502771355651&quot;&gt;hackathon idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/future-of-advice-our-strategic-framework-2019-22/&quot;&gt;Citizens Advice strategic framework for 2019–22&lt;/a&gt; is pretty similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/11/05/transforming-gov-uk-the-future-of-digital-public-services/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK’s ambition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-things&quot;&gt;Not-work things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/picasso-and-paper&quot;&gt;Picasso and Paper&lt;/a&gt; exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts is worth your time. Don’t balk attending because of the entrance fee: there’s 11 rooms of stuff, it’s a huuuuuuge exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sakamaka.co.uk&quot;&gt;Saka Maka&lt;/a&gt; is cute. If you leave having had a good meal, there’s a bell to ring next to the door. We sent up a generous applause for anyone ringing it, good vibes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shame about the Wales result on Saturday though, eh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had a play with Webmentions again and can’t quite get it right. A feature to add comments to blog posts would be good but I don’t want to turn to Disqus. Maybe Twitter is fine for now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saw Joe Armon-Jones play Electric Brixton. Decent venue! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unit137.com/2020/01/14/sound-system-culture-meets-uk-jazz/&quot;&gt;Unit 137 soundsystem&lt;/a&gt; was a nice addition too, though they could have used the subs a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Still trying to wrangle how best to proceed on the mission. Not having a decent framework for product governance is making it hard. Also, not being able to collect insights through analytics (because we don’t have the expertise on our team, they’re all on other teams) is frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And if we’re refining the immediate strategy now, surely it makes more sense for our team to stop for a bit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although some people want to plough ahead and learn through playing, which is fine until you have to prove whether an experiment worked or not and you don’t have the right indicators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent a lot of the week preparing a presentation for another Very Important Person, but it went down really well!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The team got the prototype released so we can play with it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>The Innovation Dogtrack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A decent week! I feel like I’m crawling out of the mire of the past few months which, though it had both ups and downs, has been really bloody tough. It was also comforting to hear from a colleague that product managers more experienced than myself would have struggled with what we were asked to do. So that’s given me a renewed optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; and I had a long overdue coffee at the Barbican, which was a nice spot for a rainy Monday. Kudos to Dan for picking there. We chatted about food, music, digital public services, data, data standards, machine learning, and other assorted good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented at the GOV.UK Show &amp;amp; Tell, the first of the year, about what we’re up to currently. It felt like this was the first time we’ve had anything comprehensive to put forward, as so much of our work over the past few months has been thinking rather than doing. But people seemed interested in the work and it came as a comfort to put it out in the open. (I’d love to do the same on here but I am held back somewhat by the comms grid and controlling of narrative.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leanne, Head of Product, also presented GOV.UK’s future strategy to the other product managers and designers on the programme. This is not just good but great because my team (and the programme team) have been working on it for a while, but no one else had yet seen the detail. And you know what? It landed well, I think. There were plenty of useful, insightful comments but that’s the beauty of sharing it. It’s also nice to know that things we’ve imagineered or &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/&quot;&gt;repackaged&lt;/a&gt; make sense to our peers. So now we can get on with doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first check-in of the year with the programme team went really well, they’re bought into our mission’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about our work with the rest of the GOV.UK-as-a-service team (mapping out what we do now, so we can decide how to support things in future) was hugely cathartic. We realised we’ve been acting as a mini agency team, adding flesh to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/11/05/transforming-gov-uk-the-future-of-digital-public-services/&quot;&gt;Jen’s vision&lt;/a&gt;, which has been an honour but has also been hard. Really hard. So hooray for catharsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-things&quot;&gt;Not-work things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Barker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://sambarker.bandcamp.com/album/utility&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is ‘a musical approach to a whole spectrum of utilitarian and transhumanist ideas’ or, as we normals might say, a good album.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purple sprouting broccoli is back at the food market, and it’s delicious steamed and coated in anchovy &amp;amp; yoghurt dressing, flaked almonds and Parmesan, FYI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fennel, celeriac and orange zest soup is velvety and perfect for Monday evenings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new Chief Digital Information Officer in town who assembled many people to comment on and iterate their vision. Though it’s good to be open and collaborative, a lot of people are worried about how this new function will affect their jobs. Some brave colleagues questioned why there’s no one representing user-centred design on the senior leadership team, and that’s important. Really important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt really low on Wednesday. But I sorted it out by confiding in a colleague, who was very helpful. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rrrrrankin&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt;, who’s come back to GOV.UK as a lead product manager, assembled a few product managers with overlapping missions and went through the future strategy to pull out the riskiest assumptions. Not only a good idea, it also encouraged the other PMs to align all of our missions on testing those assumptions. Which means there’s less weight resting on our team’s shoulders now. Thank you, Rob!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied to use some of my learning &amp;amp; development budget on a course about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ideou.com/collections/featured-innovation-courses/products/designing-strategy&quot;&gt;human-centered and business-focused strategy&lt;/a&gt;, which was approved, and I’m &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; excited about it! Expecting to learn lots of techniques that would have been useful over the past couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My post about &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/25/blogging-working-open/&quot;&gt;blogging and working in the open&lt;/a&gt; got some traction, so thank you, people! And I was honoured that Matt Edgar mentioned it in his post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mattedgar.com/2020/01/27/delivering-digital-service-this-much-i-have-learned/&quot;&gt;delivering digital services&lt;/a&gt;. His phrase of looking after the water and creating the culture for a ‘virtuous circle of productivity’ prompted me to start writing another post, which I’ll hopefully get out next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael’s RFC for adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-rfcs/pull/116&quot;&gt;metadata about attachments to content items&lt;/a&gt; was approved! This makes things better for the National Archives, as covered in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-rfcs/pull/116#issuecomment-577643637&quot;&gt;RFC’s comments&lt;/a&gt;. Never forget: the Web is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, use its power for good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Building Cohesion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A quiet week, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt as though we really gelled as a team again this week, like we’d scoped the mission well enough to actually start innovating on users’ pain points. That’s mostly thanks to Ned being new to the team and us explaining things to ourselves as we explained it all to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan gave a great talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://attending.io/events/citizenbeta026&quot;&gt;Citizen Beta 26&lt;/a&gt; and I really enjoyed catching up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TrillyC&quot;&gt;Trilly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/51M0NW&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observed a service assessment, which always seems like a lesson in providing good critique, a.k.a. not shitting all over a team’s hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-things&quot;&gt;Not-work things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Picked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Ben-Smith/Doggerland/22392560&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doggerland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Ben Smith, a Beckettian look at maintaining a rusting wind farm in the near future. It’s funny in parts and describes their boring lives in excruciating detail, which is a neat trick.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Failed to go to the Swamp81 night, just wasn’t feeling it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interdepartmental politics has never been my forte, but we do have great policy &amp;amp; engagement colleagues to help with that. Nevertheless, we’re currently blocked on proceeding before figuring out some politics. It’ll be good for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2019/05/cross-silo-leadership&quot;&gt;cross-silo working&lt;/a&gt; in the long-run though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important meeting went very, very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine and Matt’s first product nerd lean coffee was enjoyable! We covered leadership vs management, kicking off missions, and future Product People meetups.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blogging and working in the open</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a talk I gave to the GDS product management community a year ago. It’s mostly aimed at other people working in digital transformation of government, but actually I think everyone should blog a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of ways of working in the open, blogging is just one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-point-of-blogging&quot;&gt;So what is the point of blogging?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we should define what a blog is. The noun ‘blog’ means a regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs have been a part of the Web since the 1990s when web publishing tools were made easier-to-use for non-technical folk. They’ve always tended to be in a diary style, allowing people to talk about what they do, their interests and anything they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-whats-the-point-of-blogging-in-government&quot;&gt;But what’s the point of blogging in government?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging helps to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open up government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;form a dialogue with our audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;share what we’ve learnt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really all about starting conversations and sharing knowledge. The audience might be fellow service creators or it might be end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s worthwhile taking this a step further. Blogging is all about working in the open. Working in the open causes you to be honest about your work and makes it easier to collaborate with smart communities of peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll expand on that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-point-of-being-open&quot;&gt;What’s the point of being open?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy-tools-processes-and-governance&quot;&gt;Government Transformation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; says that ‘a culture of open, digitally enabled policy making and service delivery is critical to our future success.’ It’s written into our values as an organisation too: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better&quot;&gt;‘Make things open, it makes things better.’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being open is about the importance of working across organisational boundaries to make things better for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone in Department A talks about a particular problem and someone in Department B says they’ve encountered the same thing, they’re likely to ignore the boundaries and differences between their departments and explore the problem together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shared goal is making things better for users and working in the open helps facilitate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, more formally, what are the goals of openness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these don’t just cover blogging, they can be attributed to our day-to-day practice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-goals-of-openness&quot;&gt;The goals of openness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These come from &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmatt.org/2011/04/06/how-to-work-open/&quot;&gt;Open Matt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-participation.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation&lt;/strong&gt;: it’s rocket-fuel for smart collaboration. Speaking outside of your organisational box can attract other people, get conversations started and accelerate collaboration. (Joined-up working, yeah?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-agility.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility&lt;/strong&gt;: speed, flexibility, getting shit done. When you work in the open, you’re more likely to check what you’re saying before putting it out there. It encourages a better, more accountable working practice, as well as working out how to build the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-momentum.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Momentum&lt;/strong&gt;: communities want to push boulders that are already moving. Simply put, working in the open is cheap PR. People love to get involved in exciting projects headed in the right direction. One of my favourite stories is how Neil Williams got offered a job at GDS because he blogged so enthusiastically about a single government website, and Tom Loosemore happened to spot it. But you see this with the Local Digital Coalition too. Teams in previously under-the-radar councils becoming visibly active in improving their authority’s ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-testing.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and rapid prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;: refining as we go. Working in the open creates better feedback and testing loops, and the history of changes is documented. You have the opportunity to welcome a more diverse set of voices to comment on your work, which is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-leverage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage&lt;/strong&gt;: getting greater bang from our limited resources. And again, blogging is really cheap PR. I’ve personally made a ton of good connections I didn’t expect simply by talking about what I’ve done. Don’t worry about making things too polished though, raw honesty (or slightly processed honesty – runny honey) is some of the secret sauce to making it work. (That means you can talk about failure as well as success.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-why-blog-about-our-work&quot;&gt;So why blog about our work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is not about thought leadership or public performance, it’s about actively feeding the conversation around agile, user-centred transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting our experiences out there and talking about the new challenges we’re facing, people can empathise or respond, developing the transformation project we’re all a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we should be more open to talking about failure too, or announcing when things didn’t go to plan. Not to call ourselves out but help others later down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dxw.com/2019/02/discovery-embracing-the-unknowns/&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; from Ellie Craven who used to be the PM on GOV.UK Registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘The more we obscure how we work, and why it’s valuable, the harder we’ll find it to gain broad organisational support for the next project, and the one after that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about our work helps us better describe it and its value across government. It also gives you a chance to show your working without that person needing to attend a talk or Show &amp;amp; Tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she goes one better…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘We should do the hard work to &lt;strong&gt;make this simpler for those who come after us&lt;/strong&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s my emphasis, but talking about our work &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; helps people who might one day step into our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So going back to what I said before, blogging helps to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open up government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;form a dialogue with our audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;share what we’ve learnt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-principles&quot;&gt;Some principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some principles (for civil servants) then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code&quot;&gt;Civil Service Code&lt;/a&gt; underpins everything. Stick by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first real rule, &lt;strong&gt;don’t be a dick&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to be the person to say the wrong thing or inadvertently give away a ministerial plan or cause offence to a team member. None of that is good, but you can mitigate it by asking a second pair of eyes to look over your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask someone before mentioning them&lt;/strong&gt;, they might be staying away from the ‘spotlight’. One of my colleagues doesn’t use social media, for example, and wants to stay away from it, so I only ever referred to them as ‘our delivery manager’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers suck&lt;/strong&gt;, so avoid telling another team’s story. They might be doing great things but try not to build too much of a picture if you must mention it. They should have the right to cause a splash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-start-blogging&quot;&gt;How can I start blogging?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that’s done enough to convince you to get started. So here’s a few tips to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-kanban.png&quot; alt=&quot;A 'Blog' column on a kanban board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a ‘Blog’ column to your kanban board. It’ll help you consider which pieces of work are worth sharing and talking about. You might even build up a few stories per sprint to talk about. Break it down into smaller chunks, it’s much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to start small and maybe try something more personal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://productforthepeople.xyz/the-why-of-weeknotes-c1cd98967842&quot;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; are a great way to get going. Weeknotes are personal reflections on your working week to learn from what you’ve done and improve your practice from week to week. You simply write about what you’ve done and how you feel about how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an excellent community on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23weeknotes&quot;&gt;#weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; hashtag on Twitter who can give you ideas, but you can also just ask for help. They’re super friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying that blogging isn’t an easy thing to start, you’ll probably get ‘the fear’ about receiving criticism on your work or thoughts. But that’s fine, my advice is to just dive in and have a go. Usually your fears don’t match reality, and there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;an amazing community&lt;/a&gt; there to comment and help if you’re struggling anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re worried about writing about work in the public domain, don’t. It’s OK. You have permission. People high up at director level are doing it, just take a look at what &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mattedgar.com/category/weeknotes/&quot;&gt;Matt Edgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roxane-m-heaton.medium.com/weeknotes-s01e01-4e7f2ffe760f&quot;&gt;Rox Heaton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rossferg.medium.com/week-1-on-gov-uk-6b40e14d5c1e&quot;&gt;Ross Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need any money to get started, really, you can spin up a blog in minutes using platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a quick way to test out the practice and see if it’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to create your own website, static site generators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; are low-tech ways to get started. You might have heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which runs on Jekyll. You simply feed it some Markdown files and it builds a website for you. GitHub Pages is free too, and it’s a good way to become more familiar with Git in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you needn’t worry about having to promote your blog posts either. Services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lttr.ai/Mg8L&quot;&gt;Missinglettr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quuu.co/promote&quot;&gt;Quuu Promote&lt;/a&gt; will syndicate your blog posts on social media automatically, helping your posts to get a greater reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/self-facilitating-media-node.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A scene from Nathan Barley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may become a self-facilitating media node. That’s fine. The goal is to share knowledge and passion and get more people involved in agile, user-centred transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note-on-passion&quot;&gt;A note on passion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk, I asked members of the audience to raise their hand if they wanted to work at GDS after reading one of its blog posts. 75 per cent of people put their hand up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Edging Forward</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing notes on a Monday is hard. Hoping to return to writing on a Saturday soon, although maybe I should try something more lean. I’m going to add a section that’s not about work, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s mantra was ‘Be stubborn on the vision but flexible on the details’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reviewed some more evidence, threw together some ideas, drew up a hypothesis framework, and then tried a Value–Effort map to sort the ideas based on which might provide the highest return-on-investment in terms of learning. Conversations around the ideas taught us that we didn’t know enough about users’ pain points, so we’re going to collect more evidence first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chatted with Data Labs to see where our teams could hook up, and there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from each other – which is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcomed Ned to the team as our new user researcher, since Lisa is heading back to Amsterdam. Really glad to have him join!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evening out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chairlord&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TrillyC&quot;&gt;Trilly&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattinwales&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; and I suggested some improvements to Jon &amp;amp; Arfah’s great ‘Introduction to Product Management’ slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/leadership-vs-management/&quot;&gt;management vs. leadership&lt;/a&gt; a fair bit, and there were a couple of moments in the week when that clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-work-things&quot;&gt;Not-work things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://strangeattractor.co.uk/shoppe/bass-mids-tops/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bass, Mids, Tops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Joe Muggs arrived.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcdbooks.com/books/infinite-detail&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinite Detail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and fuck me, it’s so good. Great characters and development. Incredibly visceral. Decent plot. Evocative setting. The chapter about record shops and soundsystems and dubstep made me miss my bus stop. &lt;strong&gt;BUY IT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04c9s1g&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roots, Reggae and Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a really good podcast if, like me, you can’t remember your lessons in Rastafarianism fron year 6. My mind drew parallels between Rasta thinking and circular systems, but I haven’t done any proper analysis on that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyway, the show made a good point about the decriminalised cannabis markets (in the USA, Netherlands, Canada, etc.) being propped up on the Jamaican subculture and not making any contribution back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since a few friends enjoyed the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/01/revivalist-aesthetic-musical-discoveries-2019/&quot;&gt;annual discoveries playlist&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve started a monthly one too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went for lunch at Terroirs on Saturday. Still banging. Winter tomatoes are decent, eh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alex said that my website doesn’t work with JavaScript turned off, which means I’m probably going to have to make my own Jekyll theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juggling two teams while being pulled in a few directions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; contributing to slide decks for government folk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still more effort needed in finding the right scope for team, the right goals to help us learn. (But if I’m honest, I do think we made progress on that this week.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our learning &amp;amp; development budget is signed off by senior management and I’d been thinking about going on a course to learn more about strategy and leadership. Our Head of Product, Leanne, said she’d support any requests I made!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt agreed to meet and nerd out over product management every Friday! We’re going to do a lean coffee, choosing subjects to chat about that we might have been thinking about or dealing with recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felt closer to my practice this week!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Request for Help</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing weeknotes help me reflect on my practice as a product manager. Right now, I’m feeling a need for mentorship. Though I know the theory well and have kept plates spinning successfully in the past, it’d be dishonest (and harmful to me and my teams, in the long-run) not to admit I need a little help. How does one find a mentor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been grateful for help from seasoned professionals before, so I’ll be reaching out for their help, but if you happen to read my weeknotes and would be willing to help out, please do drop me a line. And a huge thank-you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob came back as lead product manager. Within 24 hours he’d already made some cracking recommendations and made good observations. I’m really pleased he’s back, his measured, well-structured approach has been missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team is excited to experiment! We’re probably going to use experiments -&amp;gt; proofs-of-concept -&amp;gt; MVP as an approach to begin with, using the honesty of retrospectives as a point to pivot our practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first GOV.UK product managers’ weekly community get-together was very interesting, I’m glad Laura suggested and facilitated it. As a product manager is often a lone wolf, we looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1214618166183153664&quot;&gt;times we’ve needed support and how we might better support each other&lt;/a&gt;. We were pleased to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/09/product-manager-peer-support/&quot;&gt;a blog post on the exact same subject&lt;/a&gt; pop up a couple days’ later from our colleagues in Department for Education!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatted with Ganesh about how our teams can work together this quarter. There’s lots of ways for each team to bounce off each other, learning and exploring in unison. I’ve missed working alongside him, so it’ll be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Antonia came back, hooray! She kindly offered to take Licensing back from me, so we worked through some things with GOV.UK Pay’s Katie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning lots about engaging with executive teams, policy &amp;amp; strategy colleagues, and how we package up work for ministers and other senior government bods. I contributed to an expression of interest for a new collaborative working fund and presented to a finance committee on the vision for GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After asking, Jen was kind enough to provide some good feedback: I’m calm, collected and explain things well, but did lean on GDS-speak once or twice which we need to be careful about as an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been feeling quite out-of-touch with my practice of late, perhaps based on the fact I’m working on a gnarly opportunity space with little experience in laying down and managing experimental approaches. As mentioned in the weeknotes before Christmas, I’d been using a single-product mindset which meant we fell down a little. Losing momentum can also be the downfall of a team, especially when the push and pull forces of management and leadership aren’t flowing freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to work a little more on my soft skills and I’m going to lean on mentors and coaches more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I managed to sum up some of our work into a blog post. A few more tweaks (thanks Angus) and it should be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking off the ‘GOV.UK as a service’ work – looking at the purposes, people, processes and perceptions of our platform – went pretty well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting and reviewing evidence for a whole problem &lt;strong&gt;happened&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been kind about the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/08/boring-magic/&quot;&gt;Boring Magic post&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you. Stickers coming soon. (It’s also syndicated on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/boring-magic-c74a112fa051&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boring magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been working on a team thinking about what digital government services might be like in the near future. Conor, our interaction designer, summed up &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/story/&quot;&gt;the last 9 years&lt;/a&gt; rather well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We essentially create boring magic.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just rolls off the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are things that people have to do – like pay tax, register a vehicle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fallen-stock&quot;&gt;work out what to do with dead farm animals&lt;/a&gt;, etc. – which are boring. These things only exist because of government. Our job is to make those tedious experiences a bit magical: simple, clear and fast. All the hallmarks of convenience, that works the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other (more clever) people have written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doteveryone.org.uk/2019/10/just-enough-internet/&quot;&gt;using the word ‘magical’&lt;/a&gt; in association with digital public services. That, in the early days, making ‘new kinds of irresistible content felt magical’. But that because some digital public services are actually really important parts of people’s lives, particularly in government, things are much more serious – because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3066631/software-is-politics&quot;&gt;what we design is inherently political&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with those people completely. But with this term – boring magic – we stumbled upon a way of describing the experience we should provide, in a humble way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a barber I occasionally visit in Deptford. He often forgets that I’ve been in before and will usually ask me what I do for a living. ‘I work on GOV.UK, you know, the government website?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Ah yes! Do you know, we had to apply for our daughter’s passport recently and it was good. All done within 10 minutes. Took the picture on her phone. Got straight back to watching telly, there was none of that faff in going to the Post Office, a photographer, all of that.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has no idea of the relative complexity of what he’s done. All the gubbins happening behind the curtain. He’s just done what he needs to do, and moved on with his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s magic. It’s pleasing, but boring enough to move on from. Completely pedestrian, no exaltations; he was just pleased it did what he needed it to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make these boring things as magical as possible, within the limits of how magical tedium should be. Things don’t have to be whizzy, they just have to work well enough. Because magic isn’t the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re thinking about digital public services of the future, we can temper our ambitions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/allende-chile-beer-medina-cybersyn/&quot;&gt;look to the past for lessons&lt;/a&gt;. ‘Technology alone will not create a better world.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/jonodrew&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; for his help in editing this, and thanks to Conor for the sticker and this wonderful phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Festive Break</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been enjoyable seeing people’s personal weeknotes springing up, writing about what they got up to and thought about as a person rather than a work-machine cog. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mhurrell.co.uk/prospects/&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; does good ones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.annagoss.co&quot;&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt; too, and my RSS-to-Pocket Zapier feed is growing nicely. Feels like more people are trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites&quot;&gt;make the web personal again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s what I did or thought about during the festive break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;books-were-read&quot;&gt;Books were read&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Eden Medina’s &lt;em&gt;Cybernetic Revolutionaries&lt;/em&gt;, which tells the story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn&quot;&gt;Project Cybersyn&lt;/a&gt;, an endeavour by the Chilean government to create a distributed decision support system using computers and feedback loops to help measure and manage the economy. In layman’s terms, it’s Estonia’s e-government but done in the early 1970s. It’s really worth a read, lots of food-for-thought on the boundary between technology and politics, worker/citizen participation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started and finished &lt;em&gt;Erebus: the story of a ship&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Palin, which is all about the Arctic and Antarctic exploratory missions of the 1840s, on HMSs &lt;em&gt;Erebus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terror&lt;/em&gt;. I first came across the story after watching AMC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2708480/episodes?season=1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a flight back from Thailand in 2018, a really neatly done little series based on a book written by Dan Simmons. Having only read material from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/explore/hms-erebus-and-terror&quot;&gt;National Maritime Museum&lt;/a&gt; beforehand, Palin’s book does well to frame the ambition of the missions, their respective successes and failures and – in the extreme – tries to paint a picture of what it’d be like living stranded on a ship in the Arctic ice for five years. Spoiler: it’d be awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I picked up Tim Maugham’s &lt;em&gt;Infinite Detail&lt;/em&gt;, a cautionary tale about the technology-augmented anthropecene, the Internet-of-Everything and basic human values. It’s set in Bristol too, making wry and humorous takes on the city, but also becoming something of a love letter to Brizzle. Makes me miss being in the city. I’m recommending it to everyone, and it’s only £2 on Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hills-were-walked&quot;&gt;Hills were walked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ventured up Carn Fadryn, a five-hectare Iron Age hillfort in North Wales, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gojauntly.app.link/iueQaFzRM2&quot;&gt;shared the walk on Go Jauntly&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a real nerd for trying to get into the mindset of ancient Britons and Carn Fadryn is as evocative as Caer Caradoc. The roundhouses have stone bases, hidden in a nook on the northwestern side of the hill, to shelter from the gales blowing off Porth Neigwl. We were nearly blown off the top actually, so you can imagine how harsh a landscape it would have been to live in with wool clothes and woad walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spied a petrified forest down on the beach at Porth Neigwl too, that was cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;food-was-eaten-and-thought-about&quot;&gt;Food was eaten (and thought about)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ate too much, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also we had a think about our food shopping and cooking. I want to write separately about trying to stick to a mostly vegetarian diet based on seasonal British product, but we got a few veg cooking books for Christmas to help with that. Nigel Slater’s &lt;em&gt;Greenfeast: autumn/winter&lt;/em&gt;, Anna Jones’s &lt;em&gt;The Modern Cook’s Year&lt;/em&gt; and old-favourite Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s &lt;em&gt;River Cottage Veg Every Day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-bits&quot;&gt;Other bits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A subscription to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is worth it for the mini crossword alone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting a more strict &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982&quot;&gt;Screen Time&lt;/a&gt; and Downtime regimen has helped me be a bit more mindful about how I’m using my waking hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I bought tickets to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39162542-joe-armonjones-at-electric-brixton&quot;&gt;Joe Armon-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.songkick.com/concerts/39282288-moses-boyd-at-electric-brixton&quot;&gt;Moses Boyd&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1352429&quot;&gt;Swamp 81 crew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tempted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1355841&quot;&gt;South Circular&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m really enjoying cigars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks-list&quot;&gt;Bookmarks list&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read a lot of articles too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Helping Hand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re out of the pre-election period which means I can probably get back to talking about work now, although I preferred the style of the last few weeks. Talking about topics I’d been thinking about in the week was good for me; not sure whether my usual readers found it useful though. It’s still useful to reflect on my working week but I’d like to be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; open about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending an hour with our new Head of Policy &amp;amp; Strategy, Rachel, she’d managed to pull together our work and make sense of it. She really helped with the sense-making, actually, asking probing questions that caused us to explain something or develop our thinking a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we had a session on how product managers and policy &amp;amp; strategy folk can work better together. There’s a lot of overlap in the roles, which could cause problems depending on who is presenting work or constraints to Cabinet Office. But having the conversation and realising that was the value of the meeting, otherwise we may not have realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a workshop about managing stress, put on by the programme team. It was decent and I got to learn some techniques for improving my mood. They suggest making incremental improvements, 1 per cent per day, which is quite agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christmas Show &amp;amp; Tell was great! I’m so proud of the Search team, who’ve been continuing work on improving search results as well as making design changes. They showed off a new tool which allows them to collect qualitative data on the relevance of search results, and those readings can be fed into the Learn to Rank algorithm. To be honest, I was jealous not to have been on that ride with them! Top crew. I miss them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federico explained the identity market to me. It was both fascinating and enlightening. Government could play a big part in making life online better, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave the Theory of Change workshop another try, instead focusing on a particular problem space rather than the high levels of a system. It went pretty well, but it would be good to nail it. Having clear boundaries on the scope of the problem space is possibly the winner. Also, the suggested running order on Nesta’s DIY Toolkit doesn’t match up to the method elsewhere, and I think we could revisit that. It helped us see the link between problems, solutions and outcomes in a massive system though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday I realised that I’ve approached the last couple months’ work from the wrong perspective. I’d been applying single-product processes to a wider, more complicated, systems-level problem. Some things have gone well, others haven’t. As soon as I realised this, I started crystallising some discoveries and alphas that need to happen, in sequence, to validate the ideas we’ve had. This sort of roadmapping is senior product stuff, taking a step back from team-level tasks to programme-wide projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On realising it, I instantly felt bad at having not been a good leader for the team. Though I know I’m not entirely to blame (circumstances are circumstances), I still don’t want that to happen again. I’ve learned things but the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team planning session was painful, but I’m grateful to those who put the effort in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stress workshop came with a trigger warning but we ended up being triggered anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking which battles to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading List Picks of 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bunch of articles and blog posts that got me thinking about digital government, product management, design thinking, the World Wide Web and data this year. There’s also a couple of nice stories I enjoyed thrown in. Oh, and some stuff about attention too, because this list is full of useful distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not included anything about privacy, which I should have, but I think that probably deserves its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-enough-internet-why-public-service-internet-should-be-a-model-of-restraint&quot;&gt;Just enough Internet: Why public service Internet should be a model of restraint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavyweight thinking on good, responsible technology in public service from Rachel Coldicutt, which has been this year’s hot topic alongside privacy. Rachel’s piece does well to bring together thinking from across the public service space, including sessions from MozFest 2018, viewing it through a lens of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was posted in 2010, around the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution-a-report-by-martha-lane-fox&quot;&gt;Martha Lane Fox’s report on Directgov&lt;/a&gt; was published, leading to the creation of Government Digital Service and GOV.UK. In it Stefan Czerniawski talks about how the dream for joined-up government services has been around for years, and it’s a key historical text for anyone working in the current era of transformation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-with-the-service-lifecycle&quot;&gt;The problem with the service lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service design lifecycle in government has four stages: discovery, alpha, beta, live. It’s an agile technique from the world of software development, and its aim is to help teams and organisations create new things while reducing waste. But it’s a linear strategy with a resolute end, it doesn’t set you up for what’s next. Sanjay put forward the idea of the lifecycle as a spiral, which I really like as it helps you think about step-changes. You might have digitised a bunch of paper forms, but how might you discover the bigger problem to solve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-sharing-in-government-why-its-time-for-a-new-approach&quot;&gt;Data-sharing in government: why it’s time for a new approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If bits of government start using more data to design and deliver things, what will people think about government and will they trust it? This is one of many pieces Richard has written in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3066631/software-is-politics&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;software is politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; genre, but it’s a good one for considering how the social contract plays into trust models and data re-use. Essentially: there should be clear lines of accountability and responsibility for citizens to have recourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-question-wrong-answer-agile-stakeholder-management&quot;&gt;Right question, wrong answer: agile stakeholder management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most product teams will know about HiPPOs – the highest paid person in the organisation – and their opinions. Sometimes senior people will ask why a team hasn’t produced a particular output, and Matt puts forward a helpful mindset for breaking that down. It’s easy to get dismayed or irked in those situations but this piece sets a principled approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time looking at the bigger picture in work this year and came across this post in the summer. It has a a bunch of great resources for how to address root causes, not symptoms of problems – systems-thinking. Even reading the first book on the list, Dan Hill’s &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter and Trojan Horses&lt;/em&gt;, changed the way I work. Make your way through the list, it’s great. Shout-out to Aly (and Will, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decent framework from Itamar Gilad that wraps in Lean Startup methods, OKRs, and a pipeline for testing ideas, all sat beneath the organisation’s shared goals and strategy. I tried it out on the Search team and we made some good progress. A good way to avoid the agile build trap, do more prototyping, and empower product teams to deliver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either peak smartphone isn’t far off or we’ve reached it already. The late neurologist Oliver Sacks writes about the disappearence of old civilities, where people have replaced talking to their neighbours with talking to their phones. But there’s hope in this piece too, that people will realise the need to sustain the richness of human cultures. And since more of us are putting our phones down, I’m hopeful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-attention-economy&quot;&gt;The attention economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owen Williams puts forward the idea that most products are competing for the space in front of your eyeballs. Attention is now a commodity as much as technology, and the only limit is the population and the number of waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;

Whatever the solution, making things more sustainable is a critical consideration for the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-and-demise-of-rss&quot;&gt;The Rise and Demise of RSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS is one of those wonderful Web technologies, meaning you can follow updates from anyone across the world. In simple terms, it’s a bit like tweets without Twitter. But depsite getting off to a good start, RSS has all but disappeared as people have moved to centralised silos like Twitter. The reason? Too many competing standards. The story of RSS teaches us that a better, more open Web will come from getting better at working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to the story of RSS, Ruben Verborgh talks about the last two decades of research into the Semantic Web – and how it hasn’t really changed the world much. The dream was big, the vision was crystal clear, but through lack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;dogfooding&lt;/a&gt; the dream hasn’t been delivered. But if semantic technologies can be brough out of the research space and into the world of product development…who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-as-institutional-memory&quot;&gt;Data as institutional memory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another excellent post about standards, from Adam, plumping for collaboratively developed standards as part of a system, not just a by-product of policy and legislation. ‘Fix the plumbing by identifying the leaks’ rang in my head for a couple of days after reading this, it’s a great analogy. Great stuff on designing data as infrastructure in the 21st century. (Adam running his mouth in the pub is something I enjoy being around, it produces gems like this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-data-is-never-raw&quot;&gt;Why Data Is Never Raw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe we should aim for data-driven futures because it renders human decisions as useless. Instead we should be data-informed, reading metrics and measures to inform our decisions. But it’s worth remembering that data is never raw: the schema by which you collect and read data goes some way to defining how you’ll interpret it. In &lt;em&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;, Nick Barrowman talks about the seductive myth of information free of human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Niksen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/09/the-quiet/&quot;&gt;previous weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still in the pre-election period which means I can’t talk about work we’ve been doing. These are meditations on user-centred design practice and other fluff, not my usual weeknotes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything better than a perfectly timed holiday? Two weeks away in Cuba really sorted me out, giving me time and space to switch off fully. I’ve come back to work feeling energised and with renewed perspective, enthused to tackle the challenges we’re taking on. Which is a marked difference to how depleted I felt in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was in Cuba, I read Hemingway’s &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, which he wrote there, and one line resounded with that feeling of depletion: “Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;switching-off&quot;&gt;Switching off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba is a simple country. You take more pleasure in the availability of things rather than their variety. There’s plenty of food, for example, but the menu is always the same. Better to have food than not, for sure. There’s limited access to the Internet too. To get online we had to buy cards with codes on, which gave us access for an hour at a time. It meant there was plenty of incentive to switch off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s quite different from our always-connected nature in the UK. Having little to do meant a better appreciation for each waking moment, and I realised how many of those we fill with crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s weird. It’s weird that we spend so much time distracting ourselves, mostly with our phones. Oliver Sacks touched on it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/the-machine-stops&quot;&gt;a piece for the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These gadgets, already ominous in 2007, have now immersed us in a virtual reality far denser, more absorbing, and even more dehumanizing. I am confronted every day with the complete disappearance of the old civilities. Social life, street life, and attention to people and things around one have largely disappeared, at least in big cities, where a majority of the population is now glued almost without pause to phones or other devices—jabbering, texting, playing games, turning more and more to virtual reality of every sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I didn’t do that. When I wasn’t chatting to my partner or playing cards or drinking rum or reading, I was just sitting there, doing nothing. It was nice. I just unplugged. And it turns out that being completely idle is good for you, good for your creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ms. Mann’s research has found that daydreaming — an inevitable effect of idleness — “literally makes us more creative, better at problem-solving, better at coming up with creative ideas.” For that to happen, though, total idleness is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/smarter-living/the-case-for-doing-nothing.html&quot;&gt;a New York Times article about doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;. The Dutch call it &lt;em&gt;niksen&lt;/em&gt; and it’s all about purposefully becoming bored. Forcing yourself to do nothing. I suppose &lt;em&gt;niksen&lt;/em&gt; is a bit like mindfulness, only it’s harder to make a subscription-based product for boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the festive break coming up, I’m looking forward to spending time doing fuck all again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a great podcast on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct0044&quot;&gt;Cuba’s digital revolution&lt;/a&gt; from the BBC, worth checking out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-of-change&quot;&gt;Theory of Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attempting to frame a vision for change within a system, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeightonMitchUR&quot;&gt;Leighton&lt;/a&gt; suggested to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/w_harmer&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; that we might try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://diytoolkit.org/tools/theory-of-change/&quot;&gt;Theory of Change&lt;/a&gt;. It looks a bit like a Lean canvas but for social impact, which I think is applicable to some civic technology projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It spurs you to think about measurable outcomes against your intended impact too – which is fab. So I described it as a cross between a Lean canvas and OKRs, although it won’t help you think about cost or revenue like product frameworks might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a Lean Canvas and OKRs, it doesn’t take well to high-level, generalised systems. It really needs some specificity and to focus on a domain. Writing ‘This is for everyone’ in the target audience column is a bad idea; better to have several theories of change for different problem spaces to highlight the shared problems. That means your measurable outcomes will be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revivalist aesthetic: musical discoveries from 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/renegatus/playlist/7kFVj9Y23ABBFZKpho2kTb?si=TRb7A_7tS26LV8yLESGqjg&quot;&gt;a playlist of music I’d loved or first listened to in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and, genre-wise, it was relatively varied. Beats, jazz-funk, rock, club heaters, hip-hop and some essential bass music. This year’s list, however, is quite different to that. It’s a playlist of songs that are mostly all the same, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 has been the year of the revivalist sound, with young producers harkening back to the days of 1990s rave with pumping modern tributes. The stand-out release for me has been Soundbwoy Killah’s &lt;em&gt;Halcyon Daze&lt;/em&gt;, an LP ‘suffused…with the heady fug of rave memories and long nights in the dance’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bleep.com/release/140146-soundbwoy-killah-halcyon-daze&quot;&gt;as told by Bleep&lt;/a&gt;). They’re tunes that make you want to go raving again, even if your own halcyon days were 2006–2013, not the decade previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This playlist is packed with those kinds of tunes, it reeks of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, it’s a mournful playlist. Going out these days isn’t like what it used to be (*cough* old man *cough*). In reviving the warehouse rave, clubs like Printworks have mass-marketed and stripped away the original appeal: underground folklore. It’s something Burial touches on in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/interviews/burial_unedited-transcript&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Wire&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK was changing in a different direction, away from us. Maybe the feeling of the UK in clubs and stuff back then, it wasn’t as artificial, self-aware or created by the internet. It was more rumour, underground folklore. No mobile phones back then. Anyone could go into the night and they had to seek it out. Because you could see it in people, you could see it in their eyes. Those ravers were at the edge at their lives, they weren’t running ahead or falling behind, they were just right there and the tunes meant everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when I respected music in that way. These days I don’t give it enough dedication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then again, maybe it’s an optimistic playlist. The music I’ve listened to and loved in 2019 seems to be sounds of a remembered era, and I’m really keen to go out and hear music again. I miss it: the swaying, the lights, the sweat, the laughs. So 41 tracks remembering all that has sparked my keenness to get dancing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s enough blabbering. Here’s the playlist of tracks I discovered or loved in 2019. Listen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/renegatus/playlist/38zfJWixkV78IKP7glwFyK?si=xmdXYJcsT4qo-3CiVwusBQ&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://buymusic.club/list/and-more-discoveries-2019&quot;&gt;Bandcamp through Buy Music Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s to getting back out there. See you in the dance, front-left.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Quiet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The UK has entered a pre-election period before an election on 12 December, which means that I have to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/election-guidance-for-civil-servants&quot;&gt;election guidance for civil servants&lt;/a&gt; and not talk about work otherwise it might influence people’s voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ll just talk about some personal things and reflect on product management, design and some of that stuff instead. It’s probably what I’m supposed to have been doing all along, so apologies in advance if it gets a bit LiveJournal and you’re here for Red Hot Digital-On-Government Action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are meditations on user-centred design practice, not my usual weeknotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercise&quot;&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2015 and 2017, there were very few weeks when I didn’t spend time on a bicycle. I covered 5,216 miles by bike, mostly commuting to work and back, and burned a fair few calories. It was a happy time. One lunchtime I even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/552355228&quot;&gt;rode out to Clerkenwell to grab some artichokes&lt;/a&gt;, from a bloke who brought them back from his nonna’s garden in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last year I spent less time on my bike (460 miles) and this year has been spent mostly on buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mood hit a low point this week. After doing a bit of moaning, my partner suggested taking up cycling again, to get a few endorphins coursing through my body. Mornings have been chilly this week, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; chilly, but surprisingly it didn’t deter me from cycling in to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than choke to death riding up the Old Kent Road, I take a route by the river: from New Cross down to Deptford, along the waterfront to Greenwich, through the foot tunnel, and up the Isle of Dogs on the other side. Watching the sun rise over the Thames of a morning is regenerative, as the golden light plays on the ripples. (It’s why so many of my weeknotes have paintings of south-east London’s maritime history.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, you know what, it really helped me gain clarity this week. I felt energised and happy and more confident in being able to tackle our thorny work. It was just what was needed. So thanks, Mali, and thank you, bike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategy-credits-and-tax&quot;&gt;Strategy credits and tax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tcordrey&quot;&gt;Tanya&lt;/a&gt; mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://exponent.fm/episode-176-the-second-estate-era/&quot;&gt;Exponent podcast episode about Facebook and the Second Estate&lt;/a&gt; the other week and, besides the well-rounded thinking on power and information technology, they mentioned a couple of concepts new to me: strategy credits and strategy tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ben Thompson writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A strategy tax is anything that makes a product less likely to succeed, yet is included to further larger corporate goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strategy Credit: An uncomplicated decision that makes a company look good relative to other companies who face much more significant trade-offs. For example, Android being open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re useful concepts to bear in mind when having to make trade-offs in your everyday work, as they show how some decisions can force you down certain paths. It’s useful to step back every once in a while and think ‘OK, how does this contribute to the overall direction and getting closer to our vision?’ Is the endgame you’ll now reach the one that everyone is working towards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploration-discovery-and-uncertain-futures&quot;&gt;Exploration, discovery and uncertain futures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Myddleton has written some really good stuff about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-run-better-discoveries&quot;&gt;running discoveries&lt;/a&gt; and how they’re scary as we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/better-discoveries&quot;&gt;exploring uncertain futures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One bit that struck a chord with me was about creating a safe space for discovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If discovery scares people (it does) then we need to find ways to make a safe space for discoveries to happen. People produce better work when they are not scared. We need to stop putting pressure on discovery teams to validate pre-existing decisions. We need advocates for discovery at a senior level – not people that do the work but the people that set the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all too easy to rush towards the all-hallowed solution, trying to pick up the threads of problems, contexts, motivations, behaviours, and all the other elements, weaving together a picture of the problem space. People are often worried about doing it all wrong, which can cause a bit of inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want to avoid is wondering whether you’re asking the right question first: that causes you to circle over your own practice, making little progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That feels necessary when exploring a future system state. As Jamer Hunt writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whereas the traditional products of design are configurations of matter in a state of being (finished, bounded, and knowable), the design for systems must instead open up a space of becoming – partial, indeterminate, and open. The aim is not to resolve a system – to fix it into a forever-ideal state – but to model the possibilities that system interventions might provoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the only question you definitely need an answer to before starting is one of scope: are we looking to set predetermined actions through a product? are we looking to bound a set of possible actions with a service? or are we looking to understand the wider system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having vision is important, but alone it’s not enough. Scope is also important. If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Timebox 3–5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We got to the end of the timebox. It was full of ups and downs, we invested ourselves in the work and did our best to act honestly. But we didn’t quite meet expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go into the details because, to be honest, it has been a gruelling, emotionally draining few weeks. Also, we haven’t failed: we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing a few people talk about trust and failure at &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/02/jam-2019/&quot;&gt;Jam on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve a renewed sense of purpose. I’m really excited to get cracking again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the toughest times during my product career, but there’s nothing quite like it to imbue oneself with first principles. Navigating uncertainty requires empathy for users, trust in your peers, and high-quality information so that you can deliver the requisite experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jam London 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I’ve been going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jamlondon.io/events/&quot;&gt;Jam London&lt;/a&gt;, a product and design conference sharing the stories behind great products. It’s great to hear from product and design leaders from across the world, and I’ve always learned a thing or two that I take back to my practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some rough notes I made on my phone during the talks, in case it’s helpful for others. The full line-up is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jamlondon.io/events/jam-london-2019&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The talks from Jamie Nicholson, Chelsea Bullock and Susana Lopes were best for me that day. Lots about navigating uncertainty, trust, empathy and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-with-stories&quot;&gt;Building with Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jeff-gardner-intercom&quot;&gt;Jeff Gardner, Intercom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories the best way to organise people around a single idea. But why do we think we’re not capable of building stories? Here’s some tips on building better stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of story we’re telling is a business parable, driving someone’s behaviour to reach an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good stories must have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a clear message&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emotionally engaging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;simple enough to be retold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story is an idea virus, and good stories are contagious. It can be easy to make a story short, quicker to tell, retell and understand. Make stories short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on feelings, rather than details. How do you want the audience to feel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapt to your audience. Comedians spend lots of time seeing jokes bomb to understand which will work. You need to try to be good. Saying ‘Anyway, it’s a long story’ can help you understand whether anyone wants to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make storytelling a practice, learn from what doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with the point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the scene, quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surprise!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restate the point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the animals, we’re the only ones that live in a dual reality: the world in front of us and the world in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-trust-with-research-teams&quot;&gt;Building trust with research teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;chelsea-bullock-mailchimp&quot;&gt;Chelsea Bullock, Mailchimp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team dynamics are different when teams have trust between the members. New teams have lower trust; teams with trust move fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked on a project based on a VP’s idea with a team that had high trust. Tried to reframe the feature proposal but kept running into dead ends, it wasn’t going to work. They were asked how to do it, not whether to do it or not. Users didn’t fundamentally see the problem so the feature didn’t need it. High trust team only spiralled for a while and they quickly pivoted to saying ‘This won’t work’ and the company was grateful, saved money and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual trust meant they could move from discovery to validation to learning very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you’re working in a trust vacuum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No one knows what you’re doing there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliverables feel safer than learnings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubts and suspicions about motivations and goals of team-mates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust gap can cause problems. Build empathy and trust to move forward together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage Zero collaboration: or, where to start when you don’t know how to begin. First step in building trust between research partners is asking ‘What decision will these findings enable you to make?’ Gives you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarity of mission&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;buy-in on the stakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alignment in prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully answering that requires&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;curiosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vulnerability &amp;amp; compassion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories clarify our expectations of each other and acknowledge the value we all bring to the work. It energises teams and renews trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to keep our heads down and deliver, but we should turn these into collective stories. Show &amp;amp; tell often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust over tools. Tools and frameworks are easy, but understanding and communication is most useful. Empathy.
￼
Trust is better for team health. If there’s low trust, establish clarity of mission and get leadership involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IMG_1836.png&quot; alt=&quot;Building trust with your research team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-research-inspires-new-products&quot;&gt;How research inspires new products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jamie-nicholson-instagram&quot;&gt;Jamie Nicholson, Instagram&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design for and with people. Understand needs, desires and wants. Do research early, not after building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing ideas and getting feedback is very important, but it’s easy to get lost and not move the needle (meet business objectives). What’s the problem you’re solving? How is that part of people’s lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moved from ‘Why do you use Instagram?’ to ‘How do you make friends?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked at how the different features fit into making friendships. You might like an acquaintance’s photo, but you’ll send a DM to a best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask big questions. (How do they want to feel? Uncover behaviours and mental models, to see how this things sits in someone’s life.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get beneath the surface of what is said, people don’t know what they want. Go deep to find the magic they need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to extremes. Start at the edges and move inwards. Don’t go for average behaviours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personas are hard, you can’t design for the average with millions of users. Instead tell the stories of people you find that represent a broader group of people. It drives empathy in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agile-for-everybody-everybody-hates-agile&quot;&gt;Agile for Everybody, Everybody Hates Agile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;matt-lemay-sudden-compass&quot;&gt;Matt LeMay, Sudden Compass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is a completely made-up thing that 17 people dreamed up on a ski weekend, so &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile methods ask people to think and, frankly, that’s a hard sell. So be brave, get started and change the way you’re working until it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-scale-globally&quot;&gt;How to scale globally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kaarel-kuddu-transferwise&quot;&gt;Kaarel Kuddu, Transferwise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in a country based on World Bank data. Didn’t work because they didn’t know their customers and how TransferWise fit into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran an experiment to see if people would choose currencies to send. Got some data, saw demand for currencies, launched those and tracked uptake. No correlation between demand and uptake because product experience wasn’t approached in the same way in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failure&quot;&gt;Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;maryam-mazraei-autopsy&quot;&gt;Maryam Mazraei, Autopsy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 years of work ended in failure, which got her interested in taking lessons from failure. Survivor bias creates problems for people who follow the ‘playbook’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the common components of failure help you to spot patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, Companies House, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-pace-master-product-at-bmw-100-years-old&quot;&gt;Keep pace, master product at BMW (100 years old)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sabrina-rzepka-bmw&quot;&gt;Sabrina Rzepka, BMW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with cars different: no feature flags, no Build-Measure-Learn, no fail fast. Features have many dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a vision visible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain speed with a co-pilot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the essentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-didnt-fail-your-product-did&quot;&gt;You didn’t fail, your product did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;susana-lopes-onfido&quot;&gt;Susana Lopes, Onfido&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind pristine LinkedIn profiles are our bruised egos and failed projects. They’re lurking there and we never talk about our shadow careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grew up with the ‘Failure is not an option’ mantra but it turned her into a dictator. Worked at Huddle, they had quarterly commitments for sales people, things they’d deliver on time that didn’t exist yet. Made her think that success = shipping on time. Efficiency theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By thinking that failure was not an option, she chose the easiest route to success - instead of actually delivering value to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of failure creates high pressure and clouded judgement. You need to release that pressure to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapped ‘Failure is not an option’ for ‘Fail fast, fail early’, de-risking aspects of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoke to customers using web product on Android to collect problems, hoping to rebuild the Android app and convert those people. De-risked problem and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De-risked usability. De-risked feasibility. Kept shipping and growing, de-risking beforehand…until the numbers stalled. Value plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t validate that the problem existed for enough people, enough of the time. But blamed herself. Emotional resilience held her back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she didn’t fail, the product did. And she learned and can do better next time. Separate self-worth from product-worth, maybe by creating product success metrics and personal success metrics. Creates emotional distance by being product’s worst critic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IMG_1838.png&quot; alt=&quot;Failing forward&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Timebox 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Felt absolutely shagged this week, off the back of spending last weekend in France at a wedding with very little sleep. Having said that, it was worth it to see old friends, buddies I miss, and to eat those oysters in Avignon farmer’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiredness aside, we’ve achieved what we needed to and can plough into next week with gusto. &lt;em&gt;C’est bon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending Monday at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pivotal.io/locations/london&quot;&gt;Pivotal’s London offices&lt;/a&gt; was a welcome break from the GDS office, allowing us to get some thoughts and thinking out of our heads, stuck up on a board. Also they have tons of freebies so, wow, we were nourished and watered well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been deskless at GDS for two weeks – which was really starting to grate on me – we settled into our team space on Thursday which really lifted everyone’s spirits. We’re in a brightly lit corner with windows and plenty to look out on, which is useful when you’re future-gazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/w_harmer&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful in facilitating a couple of sessions, I’ve been really grateful of his presence this week. Also Conor and Paola have been great in crystallising the group’s thoughts, they’re great orators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardjpope&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday was excellent. I’d intended to meet him for a while and it was really enjoyable talking about the digital government space with someone who played a huge part in creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I had to do a bit of a rallying call as I felt that everyone was losing confidence in what we were doing, or at least weren’t totally bought into the mission. It worked as everyone seemed enthusiastic to get stuck in afterwards, especially as we were able to clear up some unknowns. I had to put myself forward as a vulnerable leader to do it, had to profess that things weren’t perfect and soak up some criticism to alleviate the group’s woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving everyone two days to zoom in to aspects of the problem space was beneficial, as it helped ground our thinking on the &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; of possibility. Each team member playing their learning back to the group seemed to bring everyone to the same level of understanding too. So when you’re dealing with something far off and theoretical, starting small on immediate evidence is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students on the product management course at General Assembly had their first open session, a chance to chat about anything they liked or get detailed direction on their projects. Most of my students have been fine and I’ve had a couple of one-to-ones with them, nudging their work slightly, but one is struggling. They’re not grasping what a problem or pain point is, meaning they’re creating solutions that aren’t feasible or viable. Coaching them through that was tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I’m having remind myself that it’s OK to be solutionising on my project at work because that’s what we’ve been asked to do. We’re doing just enough validation to carry ideas forward, but there’s no suggestion that our final outputs will be cast in stone – thankfully. That said, it feels dirty to not be working on clear problems, though I suspect every grand idea needs to start with a bit of future-casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the week with some sketches which can form the beginnings of a service map, some prototypes, and tangible things that we can iterate over the next couple of weeks. This is ideal. It’s what we needed by the end of this week in order to reach the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Timebox</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I’ve been saying that I’ll try a new style of weeknoting, but I hadn’t done anything about it. Figured I’d give the Good, Bad, Ugly format a try from Sam’s list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknote-styles-61d957e58a4a&quot;&gt;weeknote styles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was a little different; the days blended into each other, there was much thinking done, and the new team are ready to jump into next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-things&quot;&gt;Good things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s good cohesion in the new team, and the new team is staffed with very clever people. I was grateful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tcordrey&quot;&gt;Tanya&lt;/a&gt; for her guidance earlier in the week, as there was some validation in my product process in knowing that she approaches new projects in a similar fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team have been helpful in making suggestions where they felt it would be helpful. We’ve been following a slightly bastardised version of design sprints (again) but they have been useful in pulling out stuff from our brains and the libraries of research, development and data at GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People nodded when I explained strategy, vision statements, objectives and outcomes. Bit of a shocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also neat that our work is getting in front of people with political capital who seemingly want to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new product manager for Search seemed to have everything they needed for picking up the team, too. They’ll no doubt need more as the weeks go by, but this initial success proves it’s good to document as you go; creating a vision deck, a mission brief and OKR slides, and setting milestones, updating those as the team advances, has given them a record of the product strategy to take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final thought: it’s good to be working on web products where the ideal is to hold a user’s attention for only the most necessary amount of time. In a world where the attention economy undermines the human will, we’re being creative to reduce bureaucracy and return your waking moments to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learned-things&quot;&gt;Learned things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timing sessions, giving people breaks and not falling down rabbit holes is key in exploratory work. Though it is a balance: you need to give ample room for thoughts to develop, while also knowing when to turn tangents into cul-de-sacs. Had I not had to attend the all-staff on Monday I likely would have spent that time planning out the week, but maybe I should have put time aside sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also learned to never book travel for a wedding three days before said wedding. Bit stressful doing it in the evenings after a busy day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulties&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘fluffy’ bits of product management – setting a vision, defining working principles, and generally setting up some constraints – felt hard to lead the team through, as I don’t think it’s particularly enjoyable for many people. However, it’s exactly the sort of exercise that helps set your trajectory in a less-than-clear environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to the team for putting up with it and, alongside that, coming up with some good statements and principles. We’ll be able to iterate these over the course of the project but the internal statement we’re resting on, ‘Boring magic’, is undeniably golden. Props to Conor for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achievements&quot;&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I set the goal of getting to Friday with a good plan for the following week. It was also imperative that we had some assumptions to test in the coming weeks. Thankfully we made it through, wading through the murkiness of a new problem space inside of four days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I left, the Search team passed a big milestone and upgraded Elasticsearch. Huge news! It means they’ll be able to improve the relevance of search results, release features to change users’ behaviour and improve the mobile search UI with &lt;strong&gt;full focus&lt;/strong&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Team Things</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Three Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlight of the week was the mini design sprint for autocomplete suggestions. I mostly followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview&quot;&gt;Google’s Design Sprint kit&lt;/a&gt; to plan the session but used some of our own workshops rather than theirs. We only had 3 hours to think about this feature so couldn’t spend ages explaining new workshop techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking of introducing autocomplete suggestions because it helps users get to a more relevant query or the results they’re looking for faster, reducing the interaction cost. For example, someone may search for ‘tax’, need a very specific piece of guidance about vehicle tax and is forced to refine their search until they hit the right results. This costs the user time (and patience), and we can reduce the interaction cost by suggesting queries or content to users before their query is submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team did an excellent job of researching how autocomplete is implemented on other sites’ search. Particularly surprising was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/&quot;&gt;IKEA&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests completed queries, actual products, site categories and additional content when you search for something like ‘light’. They’ve clearly thought about the different jobs-to-be-done and how the navigational journeys for those interplay, whereas most places will just complete your query or take you to a particular section of the site, leaving you as a user to figure the rest out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team scoped out some great hypotheses, affinity-mapped the useful aspects to each implementation, wrote some good user stories and had a think about which assumptions we needed to validate with our own implementation of such a feature. They used &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-eights&quot;&gt;Crazy-8s&lt;/a&gt; to think about the different ways it could be designed on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy, our interaction designer, is taking it all away to design a few prototypes which will help us validate our assumptions. We think that autocomplete should be contextual to where you are, as currently the site search bar works the same everywhere (except for searching inside manuals). We also think that query suggestions are useful but oftentimes a service or piece of guidance would be a better suggestion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/person/peter-wells/&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/person/jared-keller/&quot;&gt;Jared&lt;/a&gt; came in to chat about &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/project/the-data-access-map/&quot;&gt;data access models&lt;/a&gt; and a designerly approach to exploring data-sharing methods. I set up the event several weeks ago and did have some big names attending, but they unfortunately had to drop out. That was fine because the people who did turn up – delivery teams – certainly found it more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really pleased that people from the innovation technology programme came along and provided some of their insight to update the map. It doesn’t include current paper-based methods of data-sharing and so departments might not see themselves on the map, but it’s good to point that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent about three hours filling in a skills assessment form, marking my performance and things I’ve done against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/product-manager-roles-skill-levels/product-manager-roles-skill-levels&quot;&gt;skill levels for product managers&lt;/a&gt;. Me and my line manager thought that I was operating above the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/product-manager-skills-they-need/product-manager-skills-they-need&quot;&gt;required levels for a product manager&lt;/a&gt; for some skills, effectively as a senior product manager, but it’d be good to know how that would be assessed by our Head of Product and the Head of Product Community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying that filling in that assessment and my monthly professional objectives would have been much, much harder had I not been writing weeknotes the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Love</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A really good week. I missed working on the Search team over the past few weeks, it’s such an interesting problem space. You get the almost continual gratification of seeing changes in metrics from tests too, validating or invalidating your hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tempted to try another style of writing weeknotes, these feel a bit dry now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the week was spent getting my head back into the Search team’s work and the whole problem space. By the end of the week, I was able to write this in the GOV.UK internal weeknote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Search have brought back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=highlighted&amp;amp;order=relevance&quot;&gt;highlighted search terms&lt;/a&gt; to site search. They added it to finders and prototyped and built &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/pull/1554&quot;&gt;spelling suggestions&lt;/a&gt; ready for release soon. They also drafted a build-and-release plan for the improved mobile search UI, stopped last week’s A/B test and started another – they’re inches close to switching to ES6 entirely! The team continued refactoring Finder Frontend and rewrote some of its queries to perform 50x faster, as well as adding support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=office+%22banter%22&amp;amp;order=relevance&quot;&gt;mixing quoted and unquoted query fragments&lt;/a&gt;, upgrading Golang apps and improving sitemaps so that Google crawls us more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what the team did. But what did &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do?! Mostly I spent the week thinking about our objectives, milestones in the strategy, how we measure success/know when we’re done, and the different activities the team go through to reach those goals. It’s important to be thinking about this because, as a programme, GOV.UK is moving away from how quarterly planning has become established in GDS to something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with quarterly planning is that it made everyone think in terms of quarters and it caused some people to be shifted around every three months. That’s process over people, the antithesis of agile development, and isn’t helpful. I’ve always told the Search team not to think in terms of quarters – the work is only ever done when value is delivered to users. So in our case, the work will probably never be done because site search can always be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lean methods feel more comfortable to me, and I also find thinking in terms of OKRs helpful, so I’ve always tried to frame the team’s work using vision, objectives, key results and milestones. Sprints have goals which play into these, but we don’t have a traditional roadmap of things to deliver, it’s all about outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having checked on everything we’re doing and the way we’re doing it, I feel comfortable that the framework is laid down. There’s more work to be done on helping the team find its ideal Build, Measure, Learn process and tools, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’d like to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/site-search-suggestions/&quot;&gt;site search suggestions&lt;/a&gt; to GOV.UK’s site search, I planned out a design sprint for the team. This starts with some fun (well, hopefully it’s fun) homework to collect up examples of search and autocomplete suggestions in other products. We’ll then pick apart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what we’re looking for (search intent) when entering a query,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what results are returned,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how it looks,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the onwards journey, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the problems this style of search suggestions solves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to see how the features work in different products. It’s entirely probable that the best ideas already exist so we should look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/warm-up-comparable-problems&quot;&gt;comparable problems&lt;/a&gt;, but also this background thinking will help the team think about what’s different in the user’s context when visiting GOV.UK to look through our content set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the sprint will very much follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview&quot;&gt;sections 3–6 of Google’s Design Sprint kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started drafting a mini-discovery for searching inside manuals, e.g. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code&quot;&gt;Highway Code&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design&quot;&gt;content design manual&lt;/a&gt;, because the experience and results returned have changed since the migration to Finder Frontend. A couple of months back I emailed a heap of manuals publishers, asking if they had direct contact with their users so that we can perform some research. Having checked through user-submitted feedback for all manuals, there’s nothing to go on, so we’ll need to do some research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a retro for last week’s remote sprint. I’ll share the team’s thinking once Nicole’s written a blog post on it. I’ve been eager to have an entirely remote sprint with a team for a while but unfortunately only caught two days of this one. Still learned some things though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working remotely helps me focus and prevents me getting distracted by other people’s demands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since I already block out two days for focussed work, working out of the office on those two days doesn’t disrupt meetings and face-to-face time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team meetings can be hard when run remotely. Collecting opinion or asking the team for their thoughts is tough because it’s hard to stop people talking over each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken on a mentee, which is the first time I’ve ever mentored anyone. They want help in reaching their performance objectives, someone to bounce thoughts off who isn’t their line manager, which is good as I’ll be offering ways of thinking rather than my own solutions when I’ve experienced those same problems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Times and the Customs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O temporas! O mores!&lt;/em&gt; It has been a heck of a week in the news, a week in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-voter-data&quot;&gt;we were part of the news&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/faAg3YXpmBI?t=454&quot;&gt;Britain is a nation built on the very scowling face of adversity&lt;/a&gt;, its dauntless spirit unbound by any crisis. Everything’s all right. It’s OK. It’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a good time this week, even with the jet lag, and despite the ups and downs I’ve ended on a high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Nicole, delivery manager on our Search team, about what everyone had all been up to while I was getting sunburnt in Canada. Turns out they’d done a lot. They’d tested a prototype of the new mobile search interface at King’s Cross, started making inroads on tuning the search algorithm to provide more relevant results, and made a start on some other features too. Since the team had propelled themselves over the previous week, they were really close to the work and the mission, which made planning a really collaborative affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas with previous sprints I’ve needed to be quite prescriptive, over time we’ve made it so that the team is setting their own work and I just provide the guardrails. They know the mission and how to achieve it, so they’re exploring the territory and setting tasks to advance through it. I’m so inspired seeing the empowerment of the team, they’re really grappling with the problem space. Hurrah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit Notifications team had been progressing well too. Having built a new endpoint for the Email Alert API that can accept messages and send those to a pre-built list, work is dying down. Most of the week was spent documenting from both a technical and product viewpoint, so that anyone else can pick up the work. Further iterations will surface out of user research and feedback, but those won’t need a whole team working on it every day. So next week the focus is on making it sustainable, ready for anyone else to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/whatkatiedoes&quot;&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://unmade.com&quot;&gt;Unmade&lt;/a&gt; to talk about managing upwards, product frameworks and leading missions. It was good to spend an hour with a product manager from the private sector and remind myself how, really, it’s a similar practice wherever you go. Katie’s doing some fine work and we both expressed our like (nay, love) of a good framework. More chats like that would be good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael chatted to me about the professional development framework the Cabinet Office have given us and how it isn’t so well suited to agile teams. Everything is geared towards working on projects and delivering outputs (sigh), so it doesn’t match up to product work so well. Having said that, we’re working on three distinct workstreams at the moment. So Nicole and I spent a good couple of hours revisiting how we’ve engineered the Search team, with a view to making the workstreams more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more work to do on it but we’re mainly looking at how to move from Scrumban to proper Kanban, making good use of planning sessions to think about how we’re going to reach the goals we set. This also means that retrospectives should be more engaging and talk about how to improve our processes, as they can feel a bit light and pointless sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Martin and Till, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Martin_Jordan/status/1172869973628411904&quot;&gt;we hosted a gaggle of Tech4Germany folk&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the history of Government Digital Service and how it approaches service transformation. It was an honour to talk to everyone and offer advice for teams working on the frontline in Germany, albeit to a tough brief. That said, the teams are staffed with incredibly talented people, most of whom were clearly more intelligent and skilled than me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrej, the programmer leader, is a force to be reckoned with too. Young, energetic, visionary. He’ll go far.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Big Stuff</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These notes cover 27–30 August briefly. I didn’t write anything before I went on holiday to Vancouver last week, so they’re lacking in detail because I can’t remember much of it. Nevertheless, it was a big week and big stuff happened, so I should record it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Two Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the week was spent on getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/brexit&quot;&gt;Get ready for Brexit checker&lt;/a&gt; out the door. It’s a huge information campaign and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49545743&quot;&gt;trending on Twitter last weekend and last Monday&lt;/a&gt;. As I’ve not been back into the office after my holiday yet, I’ve no information right now about how it’s doing and whether the product is delivering value. Can’t wait to hear the outputs of other user research sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had mixed reviews from both the public and ex-GDS folk, but Paul was correct in saying that we were (and remain) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boffbowsh/status/1168067229541437440&quot;&gt;‘real humans work[ing] on the site and are just following ministerial direction’&lt;/a&gt;. As technologists working on GOV.UK, we can’t address the policy but we can help people get information about how to live their lives as affected by policy. Indeed, we worked long hours, into the night and over the weekend, to put that information in people’s hands and allow them to stay up-to-date with any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to thank everyone who put their effort in to make that happen – it was a rarely needed burst of urgent effort and everyone acted with true professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the morning with Google’s Civics team who came to chat about schema.org mark-up. They’d like to consult us on government-related schemas and it’s an honour to be involved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.porism.com&quot;&gt;open standards&lt;/a&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Transience of Earthly Pursuits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a very tough week, working at pace on a complex problem. I’ve also felt like I was a poor product manager this week or not as good as I could be. Everyone knows what we’re doing, the vision and the value we’re trying to create, but not having a hugely detailed backlog has made me nervous. Not having other documentation and specifications has made me nervous. Not because we need it, but perhaps just because I suppose it’s expected of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re working lean, not full-fat agile with your 3-month discovery and time to think things over. We’re racing towards a finish line with a limited number of ideas to validate (or invalidate), and we’re learning new things daily, tweaking our designs to those responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I took solace in sound. If you’d also like to meditate on bassweight, please listen to mixes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/MaryAnneHobbs/malas-final-mix-for-my-bbc-radio1-show/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/madpro/mala-boiler-room-mix-london-27-10-15/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/getdarker/digital-mystikz-john-peel-tribute-show-radio-1-16122004/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/MaryAnneHobbs/dubstep-warz/&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/getdarker/digital-mystikz-bbc-radio-1-essential-mix-120206/&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Three Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots more work on the Brexit-y business. We refined the designs off the back of some user research, held a planning session, started work on the technical aspects, and linked up with another team where dependencies are shared. The content and language is the last thing to nail down, to make sure it all hangs together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to push for certain questions to be asked in next week’s user research too. Alternative solutions are where you find the basis for innovation: how do people solve that problem already? Having those answers will be useful if the time comes to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were grateful to get a good response to the prototype from the rest of the programme during Jen’s Wednesday morning update. It’s also good to make some of the thinking from Explore Personalisation real. Testing some of those ideas on what some people feel is ‘the single biggest task for the UK’s civil service since the second world war’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is definitely something for the CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy presented his new designs for the search UI on mobiles. The main problems are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not being able to see any results without scrolling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;poor use of limited screen estate on mobile, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some infrequently used features being given prominence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to remove some of that clutter and give people better access to their results, meaning they can start acting on results right away. He held a design crit with the team and there were only a few questions, on the whole the new designs look great. Ian’s been prototyping the new design, ready for us to put a clickable prototype in front of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how those designs test and then move on to the slightly harder problem: what to name filters. We’re also making room for spelling suggestions and autocomplete suggestions, as those are standard features in a search product these days. You can see people making really broad searches too, so suggesting more nuanced queries should help people get to what they need sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelled to Southampton to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency&quot;&gt;Maritime &amp;amp; Coastguard Agency&lt;/a&gt; to chat about improvements to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/topic/ships-cargoes/m-notices&quot;&gt;marine notices&lt;/a&gt;. According to the UK Ship Register,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;M Notices publicise to the shippping industry important safety, pollution prevention and other relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Merchant Shipping Notices (MSNs) often contain details of UK law and are legally enforceable when referred to by a Statutory Instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Marine Guidance Notes (MGNs) gives guidance and recommendations about best practice to industry on interpretation of law and general safety advice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Marine Information Notes (MINs) provide less important time limited information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re like little official bulletins that are highly standardised and plain-English legalese where appropriate, and the notices help ships and their crew stay safe, basically. It’s important that these things are delivered to people, because the content can help them save lives, but the current implementation on GOV.UK isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a few hours going over the context, the problems, and how we might mitigate those. We concluded that a specialist finder – like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/maib-reports&quot;&gt;Marine Accident Investigation Branch reports&lt;/a&gt; – would be better suited as it’s easier to search within the collection of documents, allows for some specialist tagging, and is a much more robust application overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s a busy time, I had to visit as their original request came in last October and no one had done anything with it. That’s really poor. How can you run a website hosting hundreds of organisations without doing some account management? They’ll just go elsewhere and start their own sites, and then we’ll have destroyed the value of the single domain. That’s not on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Very Important Visitors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Headlines only for last week because it’s a busy time and things are moving fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a visit from a couple of very important people under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/people/boris-johnson&quot;&gt;the new leadership&lt;/a&gt; of the current government. I’m not sure I’m allowed to name them (I’ll check, in the spirit of being open) but I was glad to have attended a public speaking bootcamp a few weeks ago. The skills I learned worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Edit: No, I’m not. Not now, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno/&quot;&gt;Mark Dalgarno&lt;/a&gt; to talk about how product teams can manage upwards, helping the more senior layers of management devise a strategy for achieving an organisation’s outcomes. He’s a damn clever bloke and good company to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the week I chatted with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AliceNoakes&quot;&gt;Alice Noakes&lt;/a&gt; about the same subject and it sounds like she’s basically been an internal management consultant at the Care Quality Commission. A tough brief but she’s approached it with tenacity. She’s a bloody good product manager though, so you’d expect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone else would like to talk about managing upwards, drop me a line. I suspect there’s more stories out there. (I’m lucky that I don’t need to manage upwards, but it’s worthwhile learning how just in case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I formed a new team for Brexit-y business – and unfortunately had to put Permissions to bed for a bit – and spent three days blasting through the Nebula of Unknown to arrive at a minimum viable product (MVP). I’m grateful for having a strong technical lead in Kevin and I’ve been lucky enough to work alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annagoss&quot;&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt;, who’s a bloody great service designer and product manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out all the possibilities and technical complications to arrive at what’s most readily valuable, usable, feasible and viable is draining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blangry&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; asked me if his approach to product-managing something was sound. It was, of course. A man of his capabilities needn’t ask a kid like me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and some of the statistics community got annoyed by some changes that we made to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics&quot;&gt;Research &amp;amp; Statistics finder&lt;/a&gt;. It’s something I inherited from another product manager and so I trusted that they’d covered all the bases, but it turned out they hadn’t. Regardless, we’ve had a feedback survey running on the new finder since 4 June – it’s just no one got in touch to say there were features missing. Ffuuuuuuuu—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s all sorted now. We also had to switch the A/B test to 100:0 for Elasticsearch 5 vs Elasticseach 6. That’s because the new content similarity algorithm, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25&quot;&gt;BM25&lt;/a&gt;, was throwing up some weird results and publishers were getting antsy, what with Brexit on the way. It was fine to switch back though, we’ve collected a week’s worth of clicks performance data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team are working on optimising the queries relative to BM25 now. Michael’s had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk/weeknotes-048.html&quot;&gt;clever idea&lt;/a&gt;. I miss the team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Eagle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Was really grateful to spend time with good people this week, they gave me a lot of perspective. It was also a joy to see close family, eat good food and spend a little time in the countryside. We randomly (and I mean that) happened upon the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eagletavern.co.uk&quot;&gt;Eagle Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Little Coxwell, between Swindon and Oxford, which is in idyllic countryside with three courses of delicious fare for £26 per person. Moments like that will make the coming weeks bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a product manager, you have the main responsibility for ensuring everyone’s working to the same strategy. It’s important to let everyone participate in crafting it, you shouldn’t be coming up with it alone, but as the person who owns the Why, it’s your job to make that clear to people. I didn’t think I’d done a good enough job of that so far, despite talking to my team about why we’re doing what we’re doing, writing blog posts, constantly talking about the future we were building, and pointing to our OKRs often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was missing was a roadmapping session. I’d held it in my head and wanted to make sure it was front and centre of the team’s minds too. Also, our planning board was a bit of a mess and people couldn’t pull cards from it if the backlog ran dry or I was away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I held a roadmapping session with the team, talking about our goals and asking how we’d know we’d achieved them. This helped define some milestones for the roadmap, some broad strokes to achieve rather than individual features to deliver. For example, one of our milestones is to deliver what I’ve dubbed ‘behavioural features’ like spelling suggestions, autocomplete suggestions and highlighted search terms (which support users’ information retrieval behaviours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helped to lay out the landscape for the team, showing them which way we’re headed and when we’re likely to be done. Add to that a tidy planning board with clearer labels and better prioritising, and you’ve got the beginnings of a self-regulating team…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had an impeccable evening with public service legends &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Jukesie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chairlord&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve only properly spoken to Adam once before, after one of the Data Bites nights, and I didn’t realise how much he actually does at the Food Standards Agency as a data architect. We were chatting about objectives and key results (OKRs) as he runs a team or two, and it made me think about how the hands-on style at smaller places can be fun (although it can also be stressful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chatted about Jukesie’s life as a CEO too, and Dan’s upcoming role as the head of data science at Citizens Advice Bureau. Pretty blessed to keep such good company. And when we weren’t talking about work, we laughed about life, food and people, and we got a feel for each other’s music tastes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good times with the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance analysts and content designers told me how we handle our Best Bets feature, where publishers can request that their content gets a boost within search results for particular phrases. It’s a manual intervention we make where we know one is needed, which is one of the benefits of controlling our own search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this boosting is that it’s not monitored and it’s rarely audited. For example, I found that the query ‘mtd’ (for ‘making tax digital’) was boosting five pages, as decided in early 2018. But since then several newer, better pages about making tax digital have been published and haven’t replaced the old results. That means it’s harder for users to find the more helpful pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the feature needs some iteration, and the benefit is that it’ll tell us more about how we might need to adjust the boosting to play nicer with other queries. I’ll be looking after the process for a few weeks and taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Permissions team headed off to Manchester to see BBC Research &amp;amp; Development’s work on the BBC Box, a prototype personal data store to help people exercise their right to data portability. It’s not a functioning prototype but it raises the question in people’s minds of how personal data is passed around, and it’s curious to consider how not-in-control you are of data about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear that we were talking to close peers. Their team have done huge amounts of work in the privacy space, looking at different models of data stewardship and considering deeply the implications of trust (or lack of it) in public service organisations’ handling of personal data. In that respect it was a hugely successful meeting as I’d intended for us to get up to speed, and we’re going to be keeping in close contact going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/02/setting-up-a-performance-framework-for-the-uk-parliament-website/&quot;&gt;performance framework session&lt;/a&gt; for the spelling suggestions feature, helping us identify metrics we’ll use to measure the effectiveness of providing users suggested queries for their misspellings. We settled on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spelling suggestion impressions:clicks (a ratio to see how much the feature is used)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;search refinements, which we predict will go up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;session-level clickthrough rate, which we predict will go up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Buzz</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Bit of a buzz this week. There’s lots going on, almost too much, but it’s all good stuff going in the right direction. Reminds me of last December (&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/07/the-spin-up/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/14/the-gift/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/21/the-winter-solstice/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). Initially I was going to write about the oceanic connectedness I’d felt this week but it was inaccurate, if I’m honest. This week didn’t feel like being on LSD at all, but some people are thinking the same things – which is good. You have to step back and observe all the moving parts to fully appreciate what’s building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent a few days preparing their research, Andy and Jeremy headed off to Dagenham library to put the search user interface (UI) on mobiles through its paces. Test it out yourself, try finding a speech Amber Rudd gave to the NPCC or how to plan your retirement income. It’s all right, but it’s a cumbersome experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, users felt the same. They told of their issues with it and the boys brought their findings back to base. Seething with energu and enthusiasm, they briefed me on their research but said more detail would follow. Andy was so buzzed that he wrote a blog post about being a user researcher for a day. It’ll be out soon and it’s a real corker. Top work from those two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the week, we analysed the findings, categorised them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1156896490486468608&quot;&gt;marked them for severity and our confidence in the fullness of evidence&lt;/a&gt;, and drew out some hypotheses. Then I prioritised the issues, using a simple formula: 10 - (severity * confidence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 = We’ve seen some evidence but too early to say for sure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 = Fairly confident, but still some questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 = Confident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 = Minor error that is easy to recover from&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 = Major error that is possible to recover from&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 = Major error that is not possible to recover from&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 = OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It meant our quick wins were prioritised first, the most important issues followed, and anything that was OK had a minus figure, so we needn’t consider it. Then I grouped the issues by type, to check the formula, and summed the priority scores to create a problem score for each type. Facets/filters had the most problems, the results were next with some general issues to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that we were able to write up some cards for the next round of work. We’re going to design away the facets and filters, just put them somewhere else for a bit, and build the quick wins and general fixes. We’ll put that prototype in front of users to see if they encounter different issues, new issues and whether getting general search results (without using filters) has been improved. It’s cheap, it’s lean, and it’s working out the value, viability, feasibility and usability of a product before we release any code to production. It’s actually iterative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery&quot;&gt;compehensive agile lifecycle&lt;/a&gt; with discovery, alpha, beta and live phases for something which already exists. Work out what sucks, where it matters, and iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other part of the Search team, working on results relevancy, have been making strides too. Not only have we run GOV.UK’s first A/B test on live site search, we’ve also learned a lot about how the bloody thing works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harriet and Bill have been absolute troopers in trying to get eCommerce tracking working, and they nailed it. It means we’ll have a much fuller picture of how search is performing for users based on what they click. Jos dug deep into the inner workings of email alerts, a complicated maze of pipes and logic, managing to refactor some stuff along the way. Jess has almost entirely retired the last remaining Whitehall finder, akin to slaying a mythical beast in GOV.UK terms. And Michael and Suganya have been rifling through the search algorithm with Simon to understand how it works under the hood, how our tweaks affect it and what can be done to improve relevancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam, our apprentice, has also been taking on some big challenges and working it all out. He’s very skilled, I think, and will go far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that this team is excelling and almost at the point of becoming self-organising. A few more cycles of working towards goals, not just pushing out code, should mean they’re ready to own outcomes and run with those. I really want to get to the stage where planning is purely collaborative, a stage when we all decide the sprint’s goals after checking the roadmap and our metrics, when everyone can posit ideas, write cards and set to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a product manager, I’m there to help them find the answers not tell them what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat on my first panel at an event called ‘So, you think you want to be a product manager?’. There were four of us and we chatted about the job, how we got into it, what we get up to and tried to inspire a bunch of hopefuls to have a go too. The most interesting bit was that we’d all had a different route in to the industry and we all had different practices at work, but we all held the same product principles. That was cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a draft blog post on getting into product management which I can finish now, as I covered a lot of the points in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usefully I’d spent the weekend at a public speaking bootcamp so I got to put those skills to the test. It worked pretty well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Permissions team, my side project following on from exploring personalisation, had its kick-off session. We spent a couple of hours together, in which I recapped what myself and Paola had found in Q4, rescoped our focus now to something more achievable, and collaborated on building a simple roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re figuring out what is the best and most ethical way of handling personal data before the private sector defines the paradigm for good. Understanding if we can personalise user journeys on GOV.UK and whether users trusts our ability to share their data correctly, to help them, and then apply it to a thing. Dealing with government sucks and is frustrating; we want to check if it is true and possible to make dealing with government easier by making it more specific to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we’re figuring out whether government should do anything with personal data before working out whether it can. What I’ve dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1121122464799625217&quot;&gt;Jurassic Park Test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve lined up chats with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2019-06-bbc-box-personal-data-privacy&quot;&gt;BBC R&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/article/can-we-increase-access-to-data-while-retaining-trust/&quot;&gt;the ODI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/design-to-explain-what-youre-doing-with-data/&quot;&gt;Projects by IF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verify.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Verify&lt;/a&gt; and heaps of other organisations already looking into this space. Because now that Government’s been told to make better use of data, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2017/digital-government-report-publication-17-19/&quot;&gt;‘properly shared data is the key to ensuring that digital Government can be effective and transformative’&lt;/a&gt;, it should have a good idea of how it might re-use data consciously rather than moving fast and breaking things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/51M0NW&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; has said better than me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Collecting, sending, processing and storing [data about people] makes up a large amount of the work done by citizens and services, and citizens quite rightly don’t understand why they are forced to tell Government things it already knows.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;People expect Government to operate like one organisation. But it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d rather it wasn’t a side project, but if we can digest and play back to the centre all of the good thinking being done around the civic tech space, that’s worthwhile. Because there’s lots of classic change management rhetoric being peddled around government about making better use of data, ‘intangible strategy without tangible outcome’. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikebracken.com/blog/the-strategy-is-delivery-again/&quot;&gt;The strategy is delivery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got knocked off my bike by another cyclist on Thursday and my elbow is fucking killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I read and thoroughly enjoyed Dan Hill’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://strelka.com/en/press/books/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses-a-strategic-design-vocabulary&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Matter &amp;amp; Trojan Horses: a strategic design vocabulary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It made &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of sense, considering what I do for a job, and it helped me see things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Oops!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These notes come to you earlier than usual. It’s my birthday and I’ve got a few days off. Initiate Maximum Chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Three Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/20/the-milestone/&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I got together with Andy and Jeremy, our frontender and interaction designer respectively, to prioritise those problems with the new search interface designs. The main issue was that there were quite a few conflicts between the designs, and it was unclear which should take precedence. We needed to cut through to the big problems, so I helped them on a bit of wayfinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I listed the user personas we have for our search products. They’re really general because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#this-is-for-everyone&quot;&gt;we design things for everyone&lt;/a&gt; but the distinctions, no matter how general, help us remember that there can be competing needs. So we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;general users (looking to do a thing with government)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accessible users (also looking to do a thing with government)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;civil servants in departments (looking for that document they published to advise on something)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support staff in call centres and on webchat (looking to advise people over the phone or chat)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;journalists (looking to check what Government has said)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;think-tanks, advisors, and other scrutineers (looking to find records and change the way Government does things)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;using our search products. We mapped their needs to the different products. For example, general users tend to opt for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/all&quot;&gt;site search&lt;/a&gt;, whereas journalists will keep an eye on Government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications&quot;&gt;news and communications&lt;/a&gt;. This showed us that the problems with the organisations filter were more of a concern on the category finders than site search, where people expect a result relevant to their keywords rather than using the filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After zooming out a little, we’d been able to see a priority order for the problems. Most people used site search so that took precedence, but it was time to zoom out a little further. We were still feeling conflicts between the desktop interface and the mobile interface. We know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/performance/site-activity/device-type&quot;&gt;mobile use is now more popular than desktop use&lt;/a&gt; across the website and that &lt;a href=&quot;http://quirktools.com/screenfly/#u=https%3A//www.gov.uk/search/all%3Fkeywords%3Dtake+your+pet+abroad%26order%3Drelevance&amp;amp;w=375&amp;amp;h=667&amp;amp;a=37&quot;&gt;search results are obscured on mobile&lt;/a&gt; – which really sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we decided that sorting out the experience on mobile would take priority, and sorting out those issues would likely mean that the desktop version would follow suit. That re-scoping started to make the way forward a lot more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we still needed a plan of attack. We sketched some research sessions to check our assumptions, meaning we’ll be asking some of our user groups to complete tasks on GOV.UK, interacting with site search and finders. That’s likely to be some of the public in train stations, people in passport offices, and a few civil servants to boot. We’re really looking to see whether they uncover the same howlers we see with the current design. And then we’ll know which pain points to design away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll take the rest of the week and a day next week to do this, but it’s worth getting some evidence before ploughing on. I hate the idea of building on our own assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the way I’d planned it we’d be building some bias into the sessions. Louise, one of the user researchers in our product group (working across a couple of product teams), was bold enough to grab me and tell me that. Which I’m really thankful for. She sat down with Jeremy and Andy to go over the sessions and gave them some pointers on the number of people to approach, where to meet them, how to write a discussion guide, note-taking, removing bias from our sample, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad she did that. Imagine we’d pressed ahead with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-art-of-guerrilla-usability-testing/&quot;&gt;guerrilla research&lt;/a&gt; and hadn’t chatted to a statistically robust sample, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130629184453/https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/users/user-research/guerilla-testing.html#weaknesses-and-when-not-to-use&quot;&gt;weaknesses of guerrilla testing&lt;/a&gt;. Darn my Bolshy product management!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Louise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.amazon.com/alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; team came in to chat about hobbyist developers building Alexa Skills. He was interested in any APIs we had that didn’t just provide one-shot answers to questions, but we don’t really have much of that. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/02/16/smart-answers-are-smart/&quot;&gt;smart answers&lt;/a&gt; turn policy into tools that give users answers to questions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-calculator&quot;&gt;‘How much maternity pay can I get?’&lt;/a&gt;, but we don’t have a public API for those – it’s all logic written in a GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we don’t advertise them much, we gave him a list of our other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-calculator&quot;&gt;public APIs&lt;/a&gt; and said that we looked forward to seeing what people made, but to me it’s a signal that we need to promote these more. They’re there to be used and can seriously cut complexity and build time for government product teams, let alone hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Milestone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, it felt like we achieved something by reaching a milestone. We’ve proven a technology can work, now we just need to prove it can help us reach an outcome. It wasn’t a common week as some team ceremonies didn’t happen, but that’s OK: they don’t need to happen on a strict cadence, especially when we haven’t finished the last sprint. Super proud of the team though, they’re going to start making waves soon. Big ups, you lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We successfully launched an A/B test on live site search! 🎉🆎 It’s a huge step forward for the team. It means we’ll be able to test our proposed changes to the search algorithm and see how they perform, based on live analytics. This first test was to see whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/ab-testing.html&quot;&gt;our A/B testing framework&lt;/a&gt; could work for multivariate testing on search, but turns out it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday we’re planning to run another test, dialling up from a 95/5 split between the A cluster and B cluster to 50/50. We’re taking it easy because no one’s done this before on GOV.UK, but I can’t imagine it not working. We did some work in April (see &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/15/the-fishing-smacks/&quot;&gt;S04E01&lt;/a&gt;) to make our search stack more resilient, so I think we can afford to be bold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we’ll not run any tests past Tuesday as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-parliaments-49046432&quot;&gt;next week in Parliament&lt;/a&gt; could see a shake-up to Government and we get increases in traffic when that happens. Best hold off on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a session to discuss and agree on our &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;OKRs&lt;/a&gt; as a team. There’s a couple we need to workshop a little more, and I need to write an objective for the mobile design work, but the key results we settled on were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of search queries clicking on results in the top 3.18 results increases from 58% to 70%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our precision score (the number of relevant results on the first page) will increase by 5%, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;click through results will increase from 70% to 80%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers are lines in the sand, loose estimates that will prove their worth if we achieve them. From there we can better set new numbers because we’ll know our direction of travel and rate of acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thinking is that more clicks on the top 3.18 results for all queries is an indicator of improved relevance; that users indicating that results are more precise shows an improvement too; and that fewer searches where users don’t click a result shows in improved experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really looking forward to our manual judgement tests, asking users to plot relevance vs precision, inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/&quot;&gt;Google’s search quality tests&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll help us baseline our readings of the performance data against some qualitative responses (albeit captured through numbers!). Really grateful that Harriet and Suganya thought of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/04/08/how-a-cross-government-design-crit-day-helps-your-work/&quot;&gt;design crit&lt;/a&gt; on the search UI designs, to help us expose gaps in the designs by running them past real people. We’re working with paper prototypes at the moment so it’s a good way to test things early on. We got a boat-load of useful feedback and things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Andy and Jeremy ran the designs past Anika, on the Accessibility team, to get us thinking about where the designs might fall foul of the new WCAG 2.1 criteria. There was a lot to take in and I’m not sure anyone’s met the criteria for such a complex interface yet, so we’re possibly doing some really hard work. Hopefully we’ll be able to share the benefits for other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we’ll need to prioritise our work as it’ll be easy to get lost in the weeds. I feel as though making search work better on mobiles is our main goal, the desktop UI can follow suit. But perhaps we need a bit of data to see where the problems lie…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursdays are reserved for work on the Permissions team, following on from our work exploring personalisation a few months ago. I worked with my delivery manager, Hong, to shape our kick-off session and scope the mission. (We’re not getting started until our service designer is back from his hols.) We suffered by the last mission feeling so nebulous, meaning it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important to set the scope right. We’ve gone for something ambitious but not too distant, it feels just the right thing to be working on at this moment in web history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll not reveal it now as I haven’t been able to share it with the team yet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website/feed.weeknotes.xml&quot;&gt;Follow updates to my weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; if you want to stay abreast of this. There will probably be official announcements too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Birthday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s my weeknotes first birthday! 🎉 As I said &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/07/14/The-Reshuffle/&quot;&gt;last July&lt;/a&gt;, reading people’s weeknotes was one of the main inspirations for me to join Government Digital Service and I hope my ramblings might have inspired others to work in public service. Massive thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalbydefault.com/about/&quot;&gt;Jukesie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://danbarrett.posthaven.com&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stamanfar&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caffeinatedpunctuation.co.uk&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; for inspiring me in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked off quarter two 2019–20! I’m continuing as product manager for GOV.UK’s site search working with a team of excellent developers, performance analysts, a data scientist and a designer to make site search work smarter for users. I’ve explained what that means in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/05/making-site-search-work-smarter-for-users/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s three immediate problems to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I also wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/07/kicking-off-new-quarter-with-your-product-team/&quot;&gt;how I kick off new quarters with a product team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;search-results-relevancy&quot;&gt;Search results relevancy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;58 per cent of searches on GOV.UK provide decent results with most users clicking one of the top 3.18 results, but results for the remaining 42 per cent range from OK to Awful. We’re going to make that better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why 3.18? Well, initially we picked an arbitrary number to define our range of good results but after diving into the performance data, we felt that an average across everything would be a better indicator of user behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming to make results better for queries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=take+my+pet+abroad&amp;amp;order=relevance&quot;&gt;‘take my pet abroad’&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=change+my+licence&amp;amp;order=relevance&quot;&gt;‘change my licence’&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=statement+on+libya&amp;amp;order=relevance&quot;&gt;‘statement on libya’&lt;/a&gt; which have some oddities amongst the OK results (see if you can spot them!). To do this, we’re tweaking our search engine and algorithm and using multivariate (A/B) testing to compare the performance on live searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accessibility-on-mobile&quot;&gt;Accessibility on mobile&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search experience on GOV.UK is fragmented – it’s just not consistent across the site or across devices. We’ve started work on this before but not been able to finish it, meaning the frontend is bulky and performs particularly badly on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/govuk-site-search-on-mobile.png&quot; alt=&quot;GOV.UK's site search on a mobile phone, showing how search results are below the fold&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bad because the number of searches performed on mobiles has increased by 19 per cent from 6,345,649 sessions in 2017 to 7,574,196 sessions in 2018  – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/performance/site-activity/device-type&quot;&gt;a trend we see across the entire website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re going to apply Mark’s new designs taking a holistic view across the site, and make our search frontend accessible before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps&quot;&gt;new regulations&lt;/a&gt; require us to in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;site-search-is-dumb&quot;&gt;Site search is ‘dumb’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People’s mental models for how search should work are set by Google, and through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/23/hey-gov-uk-what-are-you-doing-about-voice/3&quot;&gt;Voice work&lt;/a&gt; we’ve learned more about how people ask questions of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we don’t get analytics from voice assistants; we can’t see charts for what people are asking Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can, though, see that users are asking intelligent queries in site search, like ‘5 months pregnant and homeless need help’. They’re also using different words for the same concepts. For example, ‘pregnant and not working’ is the same as ‘pregnant and unemployed’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By supporting that behaviour and analysing those queries, we’ll learn both how our content could be structured and how our information architecture can be optimised to feed those types of query: whether through external search engines, voice assistants, API calls from third-party applications or websites, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our first planning session of the quarter. We have a couple of things to finish off from our objective to have a data-informed, repeatable approach to improving search results, so we planned how to bring back eCommerce analytics and how to run a small A/B test to test our A/B tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I’ll write cards for pre-planning, show them to some team leads, and then tweak those based on comments back. But this week we tried something different – and arguably what’s supposed to happen in planning. (At least, that’s what I was taught and have done elsewhere, but haven’t done yet at GOV.UK.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented our sprint goals (as mentioned above) and why we needed to do that work. The team then broke down how we’d actually do it, listing all the dependencies, preparatory work, spikes, etc. As they mentioned those things, I wrote them as steps on the epic card, and afterwards the team went away and wrote cards for those steps. Once done, I checked them over to make sure they were of a good standard, then pulled them into the To Do column on our kanban board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good doing it that way. Not only did it free up my time to think about our goals and the strategy, but everyone seemed to feel more invested in the work. Since this quarter is more about delivering outcomes rather than shipping stuff, it’ll be a great way to work. More collaborative, like a ship’s crew pulling together to reach their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped in to see what the Structured Data team had been up to with their work on eligibility criteria. Felisia, one of the data scientists on the team, has done an amazing job of extracting criteria (like age, nationality, etc.) from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/browse&quot;&gt;mainstream pages&lt;/a&gt;. They’re moving on to other concepts shortly but this was an initial check that the approach worked. I think they’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://id.esd.org.uk/list/circumstances&quot;&gt;Circumstances list&lt;/a&gt; to identify concepts, as you might as well &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/07/ontologies-borrow-build-or-buy/&quot;&gt;borrow or buy ontologies&lt;/a&gt; where you can, rather than build them anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a few beers with public service legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TrillyC&quot;&gt;Trilly Chatterjee&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a top guy. We chatted about work stuff, obvs, but also cybernetics, comics and graphic novels, physics, sailing analogies, being a chef, heritage, belonging and loads of other stuff. We meant to go along to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stamanfar/status/1149448592920403969&quot;&gt;Sam’s picnic&lt;/a&gt; but got wrapped up in convo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://capegraphicnovels.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;the blog I started in 2012 for Jonathan Cape Graphic Novels&lt;/a&gt; is still going. Proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the chance to chat to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gilest.org/about.html&quot;&gt;Giles Turnbull&lt;/a&gt;, who’s another public service legend. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://gilest.org/agile-comms-tips.html&quot;&gt;agile communication tips&lt;/a&gt; are essential reading – seriously, bookmark them all and devour them, once a month – and I think has done more for internet-era ways of working than he realises. Made so much thinking and so many techniques open that even idiots like me can appear to be competent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kicking off a new quarter with your product team</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We work in a quarterly mission structure at GOV.UK. That means that every three months, we take stock of what we’ve been doing and where we’ve got to, taking the opportunity to set new objectives too. But given that it’s hard to make product work fit neatly inside 12-week windows, it’s important to plot your position on your roadmap accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I frame what we’ve achieved so far, what’s left to do and what’s next with product teams I manage at GOV.UK, the UK government’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-over-the-last-quarter&quot;&gt;Going over the last quarter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to summarise everything the team has already achieved; people feel better about their work when they realise it’s working towards something. An easy way to recap recent achievements is to play back the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;objectives and key results&lt;/a&gt; from last quarter and the team’s progress against those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind the team of your previous objective and the pieces of work that contributed to achieving that. Then list out what’s remaining to be done. What’s left to do to reach this milestone we were set? For example, you may need to collect some data, run a test, build a thing or achieve an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An objective isn’t complete until either the key results have been achieved or you’ve modified them based on what you’ve learned. (And it’s OK to adapt key results to be more realistic throughout the quarter, that’s what lean and agile product development is geared towards!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarterly cycles provide useful checkpoints to remind yourselves where you’ve got to, how it’s contributing to achieving your product strategy, and what’s left to be done before starting the next milestone. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cet8v_qmCxo6bJOnnMZMITyR1BVsSU_gVZb7Tv0DqKc/&quot;&gt;a slide deck I use to frame the work we’ve done and what’s left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-overview-of-the-next-objective&quot;&gt;A brief overview of the next objective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the next objective – what you’re going to do – is simple enough, but laying out why you’re going to do it is harder. And that’s a good thing. This is where your skill as a product manager in setting the vision and upholding users’ needs comes into play. It’s also an opportunity for the team to see how everything they’ve discovered and learned about users will be played back to the organisation and other teams, giving them the opportunity to help shape the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of quarters we’ve been using a mission brief template to frame what we’re going to be doing and why. It’s something our Head of Product, Leanne, put together and I’ve tweaked based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/great-one-pagers-592ebbaf80ec&quot;&gt;John’s one-pagers&lt;/a&gt;. The mission brief describes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what we’ll be doing, in overview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the problem we’re solving and who it’s a problem for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the assumptions we have and unknowns we probably need to uncover&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the biggest challenges we expect to face&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how our work contributes to the goals of the organisation (in this case, the platform GOV.UK)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the broad phases to our work and associated success criteria&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teams, people and organisations that can help or have input&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how we’re testing hypotheses and measuring outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any deadlines we’re working to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how we’ll know when we’re done, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what we’d focus on if we only have four weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As product manager, I fill in the template and then workshop it with the team – as all the answers are based on work they’ve been doing. Originally the template was very project-oriented but the tweaks have made it feel more lean, like we’re considering the factors that a good product team should hold close. For example, the headings help us focus more on outcomes, testing hypotheses and learning rather than delivering outputs, building solutions and not taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it out. This should give your team shared direction or will at least create the space to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>What I learned about product strategy from a video game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Strategy is probably one of the key parts of being a product manager, but it’s not something I learnt in my comprehensive school education. I didn’t learn it working as a chef either…although that taught me heaps about delivery models and managing teams! When I started working as a product manager, I read blog posts about it like most people do. But I don’t think I ever really &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; strategy, really understood it, until I started playing the video game &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome%3A_Total_War&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rome: Total War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-product-strategy&quot;&gt;What is product strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, a product strategy outlines how a company or organisation will achieve its vision, showing where it’s going and how it’ll get there. Depending on the vision, you might tie together a few strategies to get there incrementally. Going for world domination from the outset just won’t work, you have to start smaller and learn as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, a product strategy will be communicated through a roadmap, showing the value you’ll deliver for users now, next and later. Things you’re doing now will be well defined, but anything later will likely be broad strokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into product strategy too much but Marty Cagan is pretty good at breaking down &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/vision-vs-strategy/&quot;&gt;vision and strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Simon Wardley managed to cogently boil down Sun Tzu’s &lt;em&gt;The Art of War&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; canonical text on strategy – into &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec&quot;&gt;a blog post about being lost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-the-game-work&quot;&gt;How does the game work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Rome: Total War&lt;/em&gt; you take command of one of three Roman families: the Julii, the Brutii or the Scipii. The ultimate goal (the vision) is to become emperor by conquering provinces during the later years of the Roman republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each family has its own advantages, a bit like companies and their products: the Julii have powerful armies, for example, whereas the Brutii start off with more money. Each faction begins in different parts of the map, too. The Scipii are sea-farers and will find it easier to hold the shipping lanes, but eventually they’ll need to conquer the eastern provinces which the Brutii neighbour with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you start conquering provinces, you’ll manage the inhabitants, the economies and work with their cultures. Those people generate income, provide weapons and train armies, and if they’re not bought into the vision, they’ll rebel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on a macro-level, you’ve got a purpose as a faction (product) and a landscape (market) to enact it within. There are competitors around you, and how your faction fulfills its objectives – how it runs its business – can decide its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achieving-the-vision-in-sequences&quot;&gt;Achieving the vision in sequences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is turn-based, meaning you have a set number of moves to make each turn. You can tweak the economies, create armies in provinces, build ships and train spies, and move armies and consuls across the map. If you move your entire army to one province, an enemy could walk right in to your capital and take it over. So you have to think a few steps ahead and work defensively as well as offensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You almost have to build a roadmap in your head to visualise the parts of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-multiple-disciplines&quot;&gt;Working with multiple disciplines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to the nitty-gritty, the actual battles, you have to think on a micro-level. For example, placing spearmen in front of your soldiers helps to protect against charging cavalrymen. Standing archers on a hill gives them extra range. Hiding light infantry in a forest off to the side gives you the element of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to work with the skills and advantages of different disciplines, directing them to work at their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-be-a-dictator&quot;&gt;Don’t be a dictator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of parallels between &lt;em&gt;Rome: Total War&lt;/em&gt; and product management, but the analogy breaks down when you consider styles of management. The Roman republic was an oligarchy which largely relied on public obedience or oppression. It gave way to the Roman Empire, when Julius Caesar declared himself dictator and passed the position on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product teams are at their best when they can explore a problem space together and apply innovative solutions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/travis-kalanick-uber-resignation&quot;&gt;People don’t react well to unethical leadership&lt;/a&gt; making questionable demands these days. If a team isn’t progressing well, perhaps let them play a few video games – they might pick up a whole new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The High</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back on the wagon! Writing weeknotes last week did wonders for my brain, it’d be silly not to carry on this week. Especially when we’ve had such a banging last two weeks! This week started off a bit muggy but ended on a high. I’m really proud of the position we’re in as a team and being able to deliver value quickly next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jen_Allum/status/1143558267412582400&quot;&gt;GOV.UK roadmap for quarter two, 2019/20&lt;/a&gt; was revealed! It’ll be released in the open shortly, but this is the first time in about six months that we’ve had a roadmap up and on the wall. Already people are asking questions and getting involved in thinking about where we’re headed, which is the point really. We’re a community of change-makers, not a meritocracy of idea-havers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roadmap features my two mission briefs for the coming quarter: increase the relevancy of search results from 58 per cent to 70 per cent, and explore the factors that distinguish users’ perception of government as a trustworthy handler of personal data. Simply: make search better and carry on exploring ‘personalisation’ by applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1121122464799625217&quot;&gt;Jurassic Park test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran a Product People at the Home Office (2 Marsham St), thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/product-people-london-tickets-63102641700#&quot;&gt;refocusing on agile&lt;/a&gt;. James spoke about getting buy-in from commissioners in NHS Digital and I was most impressed by their programme-wide prioritisation sessions of external requests. Triaging and responding to product requests really needs improving at GOV.UK, so their approach could work for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben spoke about setting up agile teams and proving the value of experiments at the Royal Navy, which was absolutely fascinating. He’s setting up a Product People in Portsmouth which I’m looking forward to attending, he’s a really charismatic person. And Greg spoke about the napkin of trust at Home Office, getting the rest of the organisation to buy in to what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I caught up with Rose and Si about what Product People could do next. We’re keen to explore how government’s agile and digital methods have seeped into other sectors; I’ve certainly been to conferences where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/design-principles&quot;&gt;Design Principles&lt;/a&gt; are lauded highly and Government’s approach to creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;Design System&lt;/a&gt; has been copied. It’s easy to forget that we’re respected innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a think about how to run the team next quarter. It’s been kinda tough joining an established team and trying to tweak some of its habits, removing some of the bad behaviours, but there’s definitely been lessons on both sides. It’s easy to waste those lessons and not act on them, so sitting down and pulling out good aspects and things to work on gives us objectives for improving next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one bad thing was that despite people’s regular complaints, we’d not actively done anything to improve remote-working for the team. Personally I think we need some principles around that. For example, always book rooms in advance with closed walls, ask remote people to lead sessions, etc. It would also be helpful for my own sanity if events weren’t dropped in my calendar without warning and without agendas, over the top of pre-booked events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing was that we’ve improved planning and the team is more engaged. We did this simply by asking people to shut their laptops and get involved in hearing about cards, tweaking them, thinking about next steps, etc. Quite simply, being in the room not in their computers. It’s all about respecting each other as humans, our time together, and making meetings effective so that we don’t waste time. Respect plays a key part in that, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an absolutely fascinating chat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-hebert-0662bb1/&quot;&gt;Marc Hebert&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/designinghumanservices&quot;&gt;Innovation Office at the City and County of San Francisco’s Human Services Agency&lt;/a&gt;. He’d seen &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;my post about OKRs&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to ask about my thoughts on North Star metrics for governments redesigning services around users – which was serendipitous as I’d been thinking about a lightning talk on that during the morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to write a post on that soon, after running my ideas past some civic-minded intellectual heavyweights, so watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We closed Q1 2019/20 on a bang. The team have done really well this quarter and dealt with a fair amount of changes – not only of priorities but of perspective too. They’re now entirely focused on delivering evidence-based value, ready to improve things rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re nail-bitingly close to achieving our objective for this quarter: for GOV.UK to have a data-informed, repeatable approach to rapidly improving search for users and government in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s comprised of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our A/B testing abilities on live search, which previously crippled the stack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;performance data detailing the relevancy of results based on users’ clicks on over 220,700 unique search queries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;knowledge of users’ search intent and use of filters to limit the results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the deprecation of Whitehall finders for a new, trackable finder frontend across all content, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a supported version of Elasticsearch to boot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also managed to uncover, unpack and unhinge a domain authority exploit that a porn tube site was dirceting at our pages. I may write about that as it’s a rather sophisticated blackhat SEO exploit made up of a few coordinated tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fatigue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Weeknoting is a reflective practice, like writing a diary for your work life, but I haven’t written weeknotes over this quarter. Not for ten whole weeks. It has been my first major break and now I’m missing the space it affords me to mentally process and package everything that’s going on. Because there’s a lot going on and, quite frankly, I’m feeling really tired. I need a break, so hopefully this wee missive will help me reflect and move on to the next things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten weeks I’ve been running the Search &amp;amp; Navigation team (of fourteen people), contributing to GOV.UK’s 2019/20 roadmap, thinking about and helping shape GOV.UK’s future strategy, and trying to keep up with the worlds of tech and data. It is the hardest I have ever worked in an office job and the most I have stretched my management skills. It has been mentally draining, but very much worth it. I just haven’t had the spare capacity to write about work after switching off from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next quarter I’d like to get back into the habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust&quot;&gt;data trusts&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the Open Data Institute and some clever people they asked to think about the concept&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Downloaded into my brain all previous user research and the history behind site search on GOV.UK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with a team of performance analysts and a data scientist to identify where site search needs to be improved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with our developers to pay down a massive slab of tech debt and design how we might perform multivariate testing on dynamic pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presented our work exploring personalisation in government to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/12/11/growing-the-international-design-in-government-community/&quot;&gt;international Design in Government community&lt;/a&gt;, the heads of strategy and innovation at GDS, other product people on GOV.UK, and people who worked on similar projects before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Met with some lovely people at Citizens Advice and am excited about collaborating more with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kyliehavelock&quot;&gt;Kylie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Na7hanGood&quot;&gt;Nathan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made a mistake in people management but was blessed to be able to learn from open criticism and feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was involved in eight workshops that defined the vision and future strategy for GOV.UK, thinking beyond a website to being a key component in government product experiences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent time thinking about and helping put in place measures for how a 14-person team might release valuable features, at pace, without breaking other people’s stuff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set a product vision to make site search work smarter for users (and teach us where users expect GOV.UK to be more intelligent)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattinwales&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; how to be an excellent lead assessor at service assessments (and was called ‘Mr OKRs’ by him)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set and met some OKRs with the team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutered a complicated (and, frankly, genius) distributed domain ranking exploit by a porn tube site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had dinner with a product management idol, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncutlefish&quot;&gt;John Cutler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had dinner with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett/status/1136032260564684800&quot;&gt;UK data legends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heard super clever people talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://attending.io/events/citizen-beta-summer-gathering-and-talks&quot;&gt;Citizen Beta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Service-Lab-London/events/261829958/&quot;&gt;Service Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gave up booze for 14 days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read a 500-page sci-fi novel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delighted in watching us make GOV.UK more understandable to machines with &lt;a href=&quot;https://govuk-publishing-components.herokuapp.com/component-guide/machine_readable_metadata&quot;&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learned how search engines actually work, thanks to the World Wide Web’s beauty in being a repository of knowledge and information – and some nice people at Ecosia and DuckDuckGo were kind enough to chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of things. I’m very lucky to have this job. It’s good to remember that when my energy is low.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Product teams deliver outcomes, not outputs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A colleague at Government Digital Service recently told me that they’d adopted &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;objectives and key results (OKRs)&lt;/a&gt; in their team, but they were struggling with the objectives (plural) their leadership had set. The objectives just described the things that the leadership team wanted them to do rather than problems to solve. They had been given a list of outputs, not outcomes. This meant the team was finding it hard to buy into the mission and worried they might not explore the problem space enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outputs-vs-outcomes&quot;&gt;Outputs vs outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An output is a thing which a team produces or does. ‘Build this thing, upgrade this thing, change this thing.’ An outcome is an end result which a team delivers or reaches. ‘Improve this experience, increase this measure, explore this market.’ Setting outputs is easy, we’re all focussed on doing things. But doing things to reach an end result is a bit more complicated; achieving outcomes requires domain expertise, a willingness to explore the problem space, and a culture which supports experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take apples as an example. I eat apples because they are tasty and healthy. All apples are alike, in that they are all tasty and healthy…until someone produces an apple which is tastier. Or an apple which is crisper. Or stores over winter longer. In an apple market with different varieties from different producers, I tend to buy products with the characteristics which appeal to me. These differentiators help me choose one eating experience from the others. Outputs are physical things but outcomes are the differences made by the outputs – a change that will occur as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing an apple is an output. Producing a tastier apple that appeals to a specific audience is an outcome. Producing an output is manufacturing work, whereas producing an outcome is knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;turning-build-this-into-realise-that&quot;&gt;Turning ‘Build this’ into ‘Realise that’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague was looking for guidance on how an objective should relate to a known problem, and not just be things on the leadership team’s wish list, which &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;my previous post on OKRs&lt;/a&gt; didn’t cover. In the past, I’ve found that instead of asking what you’re doing but why you’re doing it, leadership teams share some of their vision which helps you turn outputs into outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked to upgrade a part of our infrastructure, I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agileleanlife.com/5-whys/&quot;&gt;5 Whys&lt;/a&gt; to dig into the root reason why the GOV.UK programme team wanted us to do it. They said it was because it was out-of-support and hadn’t been upgraded in a while, because we manage the servers ourselves. Upgrading search ate up a lot of time and effort, which would be better spent on making GOV.UK a more unique and special corner of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding their vision meant we could set an outcome-focussed objective together. Instead of upgrading Elasticsearch, the team ended up making our search functionality more supportable in the future, and we improved our perspective of the resilience and performance of our search infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That example was a delivery mission but it’s also possible write outcomes for discovery missions too. When we were asked to explore personalisation on GOV.UK, again I asked the leadership team why we were doing it. They wanted to understand whether it should be a direction to head in, and they also had some questions from government ministers to answer. So we came up with this: ‘Manifest the opportunities, if any, for a more coherent, personalised experience of interacting with government.’ Our key results were almost entirely research initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great way to frame user needs and outcomes in your day-to-day product work is by using problem statements and hypotheses&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unlearn-your-output-based-leadership-style&quot;&gt;Unlearn your output-based leadership style&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a change in mindset for leadership to manage outcomes or results, instead of the traditional way of managing effort and output. But knowledge workers focus on outcomes because it sets the goal in their mind, enables them to better track their progress, and enables them to learn. For leadership teams, setting outcome-based objectives is a protection against having to micro-manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An output communicates the piece of value a product team is delivering, but an outcome helps communicate the context and priorities a product team will need to grapple with to be successful. If your product teams aren’t clear on the desired outcomes of your organisation, how can they ever help you achieve it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fishing Smacks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week of quarter one, 2019/20, was fairly decent overall. A stormy week with calm moments, a veritable feast of ups and downs. Goods. Bads. In-betweens. It’s been fascinating to hear from people across government asking me questions about search and GOV.UK, so don’t be a stranger if you read these. I’m always happy to chat and glad if these provide others value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished reading &lt;em&gt;The New Dark Age&lt;/em&gt; too, which is bloody great. Go and buy it if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a rolling out our upgrade to solve an incident, it turned out that a few more incidents followed. It didn’t feel great but we had some validation in analysing the problem and learning that we weren’t the only cause. Actually, there were quite a few complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite doing the calculations on good data, the Elasticsearch machines were slightly under-provisioned, as were the search-api machines. This meant that there was a lower flow rate than usual and jobs weren’t passed between the machines as quickly as usual. On top of that, some new features on finder-frontend added significant overhead to its processes, and an A/B test was pushing tons of traffic through to the origin servers. (Michael has explained it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk/weeknotes-030.html&quot;&gt;more technical detail&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the entire search stack was being overloaded unprecedentedly. It was the embodiment of ‘Move fast, break things’, but really that’s the worst thing to do during a tense political time. ‘Move fast, spark joy’ should be our mantra right now. I’m hoping we can improve our testing suite, where needed, and that other teams will be good citizens in future by running performance testing on new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to run the sums again but the money we’ve saved taxpayers will probably have decreased now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kick-off for Search &amp;amp; Navigation went pretty well. Most people seemed to get behind the ethos of pushing for behaviour change, not creating a feature factory. It really excited our senior user researcher, Louise, who’s overflowing with excellent knowledge about how people find things. We’ve got a huge opportunity to add value to site search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another session with the team later in the week was valuable too. I ran through their icebox to see which features might give users value with minimal effort, but everyone was keen to learn more about users – how we measure user value, especially – before releasing anything. It was really great to hear, as everything we do should be rooted in solving validated user problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy joining a team with an established culture but everyone has been welcoming and open to our objectives. That said, the objectives are pretty fluffy at the moment, but we’ll be giving them more definition as the weeks progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unconference was really good, especially Jen’s talk on the future of GOV.UK. A few of our findings from Explore Personalisation had snuck their way in – people seemed to react well enough. Jen essentially did our presentation but way better, so we’re going to chat to her this week about binding the narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11POnQ_qVz6WX6wr3eU_KW0sZy6BL1SFtR8hqdfNsWrs&quot;&gt;blogging and working in the open&lt;/a&gt; went well. I followed up with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1115316176740134912&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; which went a bit viral, I hope in support of blogging in public service. I started writing a blog post about that, a better-worded version of the presentation, but the gremlins on my computer ate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeated Dai’s work and counted &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KsmJcir_ZedxB4gV5sVX2whB2M6c15Px0VargcQpHNY/edit#gid=1947375863&quot;&gt;how many blog posts have been published on the GDS blogs&lt;/a&gt;, which, as you’ll now doubt expect, have been trending downwards. Having said that, quality is more important than quantity, and the Head of Editorial has &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/22/making-sure-our-blogging-meets-user-needs/&quot;&gt;blogged previously&lt;/a&gt; about prioritising impact over excess. I pulled the analytics data and ran a quick analysis, which shows that engagement has increased despite the number of posts not remaining constant. Clearly the measures aren’t directly related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I still think people need to blog more, it’s not a case of going back to blogging three times a day, like the early days. Once a week, telling stories from product teams, would be nice. (And thank you to everyone across government who’s asked me about search in the last week, I didn’t know so many people read my weeknotes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed assessor training, so I’m on my way to being a lead assessor on service assessments. I’m looking forward to working with service teams across government tackle users’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I perform against my objectives this week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

        <title>The Relief</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We launched a thing and saved taxpayers money, found out the missions for next quarter, and I’ve prepped a presentation on blogging and working in the open. A decent week considering I spent all of it at home, working in the lounge, with a rotten cold and many sniffles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We completed the search migration! 🎉 All applications are now using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/search-api&quot;&gt;Search API&lt;/a&gt; in all environments, meaning better search latency, an improved architecture for resilience, and we can start exploiting the new features in Elasticsearch 5.6 (and beyond). It’s saving taxpayers around £35,000 per year too, which is a Good Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to roll it out in good fashion too. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.publishing.service.gov.uk/incidents/s0fj6yqdz6wp&quot;&gt;incident&lt;/a&gt; fired up on Tuesday which was throwing hundreds of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;500&lt;/code&gt; errors and it was proving tricky to get to the root cause. We were on the verge of rolling out anyway but were doing some final checks on search result ordering. All results were coming through as expected or with minimal variance in their ordering, except for organisation pages which were showing a strange behaviour – but not so strange that the user experience would be massively degraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we did a quick check on the top 10,000 search terms and decided it was fine to go ahead. It took barely any time at all and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;500&lt;/code&gt; errors started dropping soon after. By the next day, they’d dropped even further, and as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/barrucadu&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, having Rummager running alongside Search API was a good way to see how much better the new infrastructure is at clearing the job queues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good win for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams for Q1 2019/20 have been announced. I’m going to be leading a team looking at making GOV.UK’s site search better for users and optimising our pages for other search engines through semantic markup. I’m also going to be a consultant product manager on a team looking at how GOV.UK can best implement structured data and graph technology, which follows on nicely from some of the Explore Personalisation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is hugely exciting for me as I’ve been advocate of semantics and structured data ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker/&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; schooled me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://porism.com&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll still be looking at user behaviour on the website through search, where people feed their mental models into our system through language. There’s a massive opportunity to observe a shift in search behaviour as people move away from keyword searches towards asking full questions. (I assume that’s what might happen anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to be able to release some Big Bang features too, which users have been asking about for a while. Most people expect site search to work like Google, so I’m hyped to explore how we do that whilst maintaining a high degree of user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be encouraging the team to share our findings through livestreamed Show &amp;amp; Tells and I’ll promote these to local government audiences (in the main) as they might find the outputs useful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/p2v1a2uTSW33KapV6&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; to receive a link to the stream as we’re due to go live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning how to kick-off the new mission was really fun. I pored through a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncutlefish&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;’s articles as I like his style for promoting a learning culture and focusing on user behaviour. It meshes with GDS’s ‘Users First’ dogma quite nicely but encourages a level of experimentation you don’t often hear about outside the Discovery-Alpha-Beta-Live lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll write up my approach here, see what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;behaviour-change&quot;&gt;Behaviour change&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose behaviour are we hoping to change? Which behaviours do we hope to change? This will help us consider &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is using search and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; needs to be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we know whose behaviours we’re going to change and how they currently use the thing, we can better know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we think we’ll change those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ideas&quot;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all probably have ideas for what to do. Things we can build. Avenues to explore. We can set those hypotheses later, once we’ve all shared some learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-we-know-now&quot;&gt;What we know now&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we each need to learn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;about our users,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;why they search,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how they search, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how search works in order to proceed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared understanding now will help massively later. (And it’s possible that I need to learn the most!) Do we have a backlog or institutional knowledge? Do those need updating?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hypotheses&quot;&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re on the same page, what assumptions do we have? How will we validate or invalidate those? (Experiments or research.) What outcomes do we expect to bring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;success&quot;&gt;Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will we know when we’re done and measure success? What metrics and KPIs do we have that show people are getting what they need? Do we have a North Star? How does that relate to GOV.UK’s goals and vision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;tweet me&lt;/a&gt; with thoughts and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’ll be speaking at the GDS product management community meet-up on Monday, I finished off my presentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11POnQ_qVz6WX6wr3eU_KW0sZy6BL1SFtR8hqdfNsWrs&quot;&gt;blogging and working in the open&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of nice people offered to read it and provide comment, so it has been refined slightly, but it says what I want. The aim is to encourage people to blog more about the work they do, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://daibach.uk/2018/02/state-blogging-digital-government/&quot;&gt;the frequency of blog-posting has dropped&lt;/a&gt; but people still deserve to know how their taxes are being spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just realised that I haven’t included that line in the slides…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I perform against my objectives this week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

        <title>The Road Ahead</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of quarter 4, 2018/19. We’ve done a heck of a lot and there’s palpable excitement at what’s to come next quarter. Keep an eye out for the GOV.UK Roadmap 2019/20, which we’re hoping to launch very, very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end-of-quarter Show &amp;amp; Tell was really top notch and it was impressive to see how much teams had achieved during an intense political period. The EU Exit Voltron mega-team have managed to churn out heaps of goodness for people, and it’s seriously impressive that Sam managed to turn the ‘dynamic FAQs’ request into ‘No, but here’s some improvements to Search’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform Health have managed to get concrete numbers on how much load the platform can put up with too, which means they can look at the architecture strategy going forward. Content Data have added reading time to their metrics, meaning you can find out how long it takes to read things like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2018-documents/budget-2018&quot;&gt;Budget 2018&lt;/a&gt; (answer: 3h 26m). Filtered lists (we call those Finders) are more consistent, and a machine-learning algorithm has helped humans curate related links on pages, which other humans find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to announce that we’re saving taxpayers £35,000 a year off the back of our Search Resilience &amp;amp; Performance mission, and I wrote it on the side of a bus. Then I showed how we might (I must stress, might) personalise the experience of interacting with government, based on what we’d found from speaking to international governments and senior stakeholders. Next we need to find a politician willing to spend the political capital required to make a natively digital nation a reality in the UK. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was a boon to wrap up the quarter knowing that Government Communication Service and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/people/john-manzoni&quot;&gt;Chief Executive of the Civil Service&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others, think that GOV.UK is staffed by cool and capable people. That this digital thing might just be a better way of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee, a delivery manager, helped me by facilitating a recap session with the Explore Personalisation team. We asked ourselves what we’d learnt in our proto-discovery, to inform what recommendations we’d make to take the work forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main finding: ‘personalisation’ is a fuzzy, poorly defined term and means different things to different people. The thing pictured in your head is not the same for everyone. Talk about value you’d like to create, not things you want to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have come up with some good opportunities worth pursuing in low effort, lean experimental ways. Testing the feasibility of features with something as simple as a button and a user research sign-up form takes minutes and can tell you a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started writing the blog post and report for this work and I can’t wait to share that soon. It’ll try to describe what personalisation is, how we’re already personalising bits of GOV.UK, and what more we could do to personalise interacting with government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael and Bruce did even more digging into Elasticsearch and how it orders results. Some logic around synonyms had been throwing the results, which we didn’t expect and isn’t documented as a change by Elasticsearch. The good news is that we’re getting closer to being able to roll it out to Production fully, probably by Wednesday after we’ve uncovered the results ordering gremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I helped &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JPForman86?lang=en&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Product Community, get to grips with publishing things on GitHub. He’s come up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/Product-Managers-Learn-By-Doing&quot;&gt;things you need to do in order to learn and develop as an associate product manager&lt;/a&gt;, which he developed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scottcolfer?lang=en&quot;&gt;Scott Colfer&lt;/a&gt;. The first version is rather good and it’s published in the open, meaning anyone can make comments and suggest additions or changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled on some development objectives which I’ll publish and report on in the open. See below. They’re designed to help me develop my skills in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/product-manager-skills-they-need/product-manager-skills-they-need&quot;&gt;DDaT Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Will report progress next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contribute to the GDS PM community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partner with delivery manager to run a multidisciplinary team (agile working)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Light-bulb moments, chats with good people, reading research. All part of this week in my life as a civil servant. Tell you what, I could do with a reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Three Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what may be the last time during this quarter, I got a few folks on the Explore Personalisation mission together in a room to think about personal data as part of service design and features. We spent about 90 minutes saying ‘Hmm…’ while moving some Post-its around, then drew a diagram on the wall (which is covered in whiteboard paint). It was a funnel with four levels and some words and arrows either side. That was a bit of a light-bulb moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great moment because, to be honest, working on this nebulous mission has pushed me to the limits of my craft – and at times I’ve doubted I’m even any good at it. Trying to move a team of highly intelligent people through a sensitive design problem is Rather Hard, especially when they’re nabbed to work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/business-uk-leaving-eu&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/prepare-eu-exit&quot;&gt;more pressing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/uk-nationals-living-eu&quot;&gt;issues in government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So hopefully the product of our hard-thinking is valuable and answers a question correctly for the higher-ups. We would have preferred to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/quit-planning-ahead-and-keeping-people-busy-937e74d5a1fb&quot;&gt;focus instead on being present for the important task at hand&lt;/a&gt;, not sliced up, wafer-thin, and draped across several sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another large portion of the week was spent beginning to craft the narrative to sell our work. That means I poured some words into a slide deck and reviewed the history of GDS, while also tearing apart some &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.accenture.com/industries/health-public-service/citizen-enthusiasm-for-personalized-government-services-and-digital-innovation-are-on-the-rise-accenture-survey-finds.htm&quot;&gt;poor research&lt;/a&gt; (Internet of Things for your benefits history, anyone?) which informs decision-makers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nesta.org.uk/news/at-the-dawn-of-gdpr-nesta-warns-it-is-high-time-for-data-innovation-not-just-regulating-business-as-usual/&quot;&gt;Better polls&lt;/a&gt; are available, so the narrative will include those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re getting mighty close to rolling the Elasticsearch upgrade out to Production, but first we’re checking whether the upgrade will affect the ordering of search results – which it will, though not by much. 80 per cent of the top 1,000 searches return the same link in first place; 60 per cent have the same links in first and second place. The next question to answer is ‘How many searches return the same links in the first set of ten results?’ Because as long as a link doesn’t move more than four or five places, users will likely still be able to find it easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve spent a while digging in to how weightings and similarity scores work, we’re rather well placed to work on those next quarter – which we’ll have to anyway since indexing changes completely between v5 and v6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, hooray, I’m not an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&quot;&gt;imposter&lt;/a&gt;! Neither are you, probably. We’re all making it up as we go along. And so here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1095610533187911681&quot;&gt;the best life advice I’ve ever received&lt;/a&gt;, for you to remember and act on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make my monthly objectives part of my weeknotes. I said before that I’d do that and I haven’t. Definitely worse at making lists recently. Need to return to making lists. Self-organisation? Yes, I could be better a self-organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Key Findings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I started to see the end of the tunnel for the personalisation mission. That doesn’t mean we’ve figured it all out, rather that we know it’ll take longer to answer this question – but we’ve noticed the first stage. It’s going to require all my dexterity of character and strategic skills to carry the rest through, so it’s time to take another step up…probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrouped the Explore Personalisation team to run through the results of our research. It’s been mainly myself and Paola interviewing people, with the occasional bit of help from Tim and Kate, while Mark has been focussing on the desk research. This session meant everyone was able to spend time writing up the findings from interviews with senior stakeholders and international governments, observing where the research might converge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drew out some key themes from the findings and started to think about risks and opportunities. There’s some tidbits of value in there which need exploring, but many of our assumptions were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product managers got together to review our 2019–20 roadmap for GOV.UK. It’s a tough time to be ambitious, what with Brexit and all, so we ranked missions based on immediate priority. If it turns out that Brexit doesn’t demand too much of our time, we’ll be able to open up some exciting missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/allan-donald-72b543b/&quot;&gt;Allan Donald&lt;/a&gt; came in to talk about metadata and content at the BBC. It was hugely enjoyable and I picked up some presentation tips, alongside all the good chatter about semantics, structure and tagging content intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Explore Personalisation team grouped again, this time to assess the signals we were seeing in the research. Some scenarios were put together in which a particular feature idea might have been useful. However, we were uncomfortable with the solutionising and the main problem was that all the ideas had such a range of personalisation at play. From simple reminders to consent control, from tailored navigation to fully integrated cross-department data layers, there was a ton to process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided to put together a ‘scale of personalisation’ mapping the value a user might get against the level of personal data they’d need to hand over. It’s all theory but should form the basis for some design principles around using personal data. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com&quot;&gt;Data Permissions Catalogue&lt;/a&gt; by Projects by IF and the Open Data Institute’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/&quot;&gt;Data Ethics Canvas&lt;/a&gt; have been useful in guiding our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an enjoyable time talking to our Director of Delivery &amp;amp; Support, David Lewis, whose experience in digital transformation is quite impressive. He offered his time as a sounding board for our queries, which I’d like to take him up on. It was also helpful to speak with Kevin Cunnington, our Director General, this week and hear what he’s up to on his own frontlines for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the most senior of stakeholders can be approachable, and actually it’s time to step my game up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public speaking and confidence in presentations. I often get butterflies and have a few techniques to deal with those, but I’d like to do better. I’ve signed up to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/education/present-for-success-public-speaking-bootcamp&quot;&gt;public speaking bootcamp at General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Threads</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating chat with Corinne Cordes who worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ict.govt.nz/programmes-and-initiatives/government-service-innovation/result-10/research-exec-intro-methodology-concl/&quot;&gt;Results 10&lt;/a&gt;, the New Zealand government’s early research into government transformation a few years ago. The interesting point was that they felt picking out life events as a solution was midjudged, but then hindsight is 20/20 vision – it’s easy to say that. Mind you, they’ve gone on to look into legislation-as-code which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://apolitical.co/solution_article/new-zealand-explores-machine-readable-laws-to-transform-government/&quot;&gt;covered by Apolitical&lt;/a&gt; the same day, coincidentally. I’d like to pick up that thread with them and explore the area more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chatted with people from the Netherlands and Germany governments too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check-in with the programme team went well, not much to report beyond the fact that no other government provides personalised, customised homepages, etc. One of our key results is to prototype and test our riskiest hypotheses, and they questioned whether there was enough time left to do that. It’s hard when your team has been taken away and put on other missions, but I don’t think we can justly arrive at a conclusion without some hard evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put together a roadmap for upgrading to Elasticsearch (ES) 6 in the near future. EU Exit on 29 March means we’ll possibly not be able to switch over to our new ES 5.6 clusters as soon as we’d liked, because it’s better to leave all systems stable and operational that week instead of introducing new complexity to the stack. But it’s good to have clarity for how long it will likely take us to jump to ES 6 next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about continued search performance during the Brexit period raised an old idea to repurpose Search Performance Explorer to ensure that search results rankings persist during the upgrade. We may need to spin up something quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually got the opportunity to present our work on the cache clearing service, front-end resilience and load-testing the publishing pipeline, which we were originally billed to do in October (see &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/10/21/The-Unconference/&quot;&gt;S02E02&lt;/a&gt;). It seemed to be received well and it was good to show the work we’d done on securing the operations of the platform for Brexity busy-ness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The registry-up vs services-down models of government transformation come up against issues of siloed departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few strands of work across the programme started to converge in my head this week, but I’ve not given much time towards planning out the work for next quarter to bring those together. I’ll need to prepare before my meeting with Ganesh next week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Reflection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s all coming together. An impromptu beer with Trilly on Monday set me up for a reflective week. So here’s to the next 12 months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half the week was spent writing up my performance objectives for the year. This involves setting a deliverable (it’s an outcome, really), describing the behaviours for how you’ll achieve it, and then relating things you’ve actually done to those behaviours. For example, I wanted to manage and reduce the massive backlog on Platform Health, so I set up points during the week to do that, created a bugs prioritisation framework (with Martin) and actively worked through cards. Each retro we reported the number of bugs and other cards dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had various objectives described and met like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage the massive backlog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contribute to the GDS product management community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a sustainable workload&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lead the team on pipeline work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify opportunities to make GOV.UK healthier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frame problems and set priorities for product work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work in the open&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filling in the sheet was time-consuming but not as laborious as it could have been, thanks to having written weeknotes since July 2018. It was good to reflect on the last 12 months as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paola and I spoke to the Estonian government about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eesti.ee/en&quot;&gt;state portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-estonia.com/solutions/interoperability-services/x-road/&quot;&gt;X-Road&lt;/a&gt; and the intersection between service provision, legislation, politics and representation. I wondered how they might ensure universal and fair high-quality service delivery for people not part of the digital programme. Apparently 98% of people have access to a computer and the Internet – but that doesn’t mean they can or do use it. It’s good that they’re an enabler of GDPR though and people aren’t limited by needing to apply for things, their citizens can get benefits automatically. They also &lt;a href=&quot;https://apolitical.co/solution_article/data-exchange-platform-making-estonia-leader-digital-governance/&quot;&gt;save 240 working hours every 3 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to speak to Pete H about when &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/31/government-as-a-data-model-what-i-learned-in-estonia/&quot;&gt;he visited Estonia in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also chatted to Allan Donald at the BBC about their personalisation of content. As a semantics and metadata fan, it was pretty interesting, but so too were the tales of their content operating model and governance. It has not been without its trials and tribulations. He’s coming to visit to tell us more about how it works and what problems it solves, which is really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, research into this space continues but we’ll not draw any conclusions until we’ve heard the voice of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few back-and-forth messages with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service&quot;&gt;HMCTS&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple of months, they’re looking at moving towards publishing in HTML rather than updating 50 PDFs &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;. It means they don’t have to get in touch every time there’s an anonymity order and their content will be more accessible. The cost to them? ‘Not much of a problem’ according to one of their people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all came about because I spent 15 minutes chatting on the phone after they sent through an urgent support request. 15 minutes spent understanding the nature of their problem, assessing the options together, which gave us chance to deliver a better, long-term solution for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 15 minutes chatting to another human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I need to change my weeknotes slightly, so that they feed directly into my performance objectives. Might as well make them work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend more time thinking about next quarter. This will help in check-in next week and feed into planning for next quarter too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>The Syndication</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit late getting these out, it was a busy weekend so I didn’t have time to write my weeknotes. A decent week but, given that we’re halfway through the quarter, it feels like I’m running out of time to write a white paper on personalisation. That shouldn’t feel the case. It’s not possible to explore ideas fully within a deadline; it’ll end when it ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Martin_Jordan&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Service Design, to chat about life events and what’s going on in digital government internationally. He hooked us up with some useful people in Germany and Estonia, and I shared some work Porism did on &lt;a href=&quot;http://id.esd.org.uk/list/lifeEvents&quot;&gt;life events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://id.esd.org.uk/list/circumstances&quot;&gt;circumstances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also chatted with Christina, a user researcher at DfE but previously working at HMRC, about work she’d been involved in called ‘credential alignment’. Some research participants expressed frustration that there wasn’t a link between HMRC services and Companies House services, and it’s possible there’s more gaps like that across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing a talk for the GDS product management community meet-up about blogging and working in the open. The aim is to encourage more product managers at GDS to blog about their work, either on the official blogs or elsewhere, but I spent all the time talking about the idea behind working in the open. So I’m not sure how that’s going to inspire people. It probably sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do let me know if you’d be happy to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team-mates on Search Resilience &amp;amp; Performance got the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/search-api&quot;&gt;search-api&lt;/a&gt; working in Integration, including queries for other applications, really quickly. They had to switch back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/rummager&quot;&gt;rummager&lt;/a&gt; briefly for some priortised testing but it didn’t disrupt them too much. They spent the time working out how to create a ‘super schema’ for document type mapping, which should mean that upgrading from Elasticsearch v5.6 to v6 will be a one-click upgrade. This will also give the new application time to bed down, exposing any issues we might miss by pressing on too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also explored using machines with different specifications for the master nodes and data nodes. It’s actually cheaper doing it that way, which is nice, so it’ll save tax-payers more money in the long-run – which is great. Next we’re testing different sharding options to optimise the latency and resilience of the clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent lots of time writing and practising a presentation about our work on GOV.UK for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180801140850/https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/digital/digital-centre-of-excellence/&quot;&gt;Digital Centre of Expertise&lt;/a&gt;, a meeting of digital marketing and communications professionals from across government. Because I’m in the early stages of exploring something – what I’m calling a strategic discovery – I spent my 5 minutes talking about generative research and innovating on evidenced user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit vague about what we’ve been doing, really, but that’s the point: I don’t want anyone to think we’re committing to any technical solutions before we’ve found a problem to solve. Whilst I’m arguably in the business of innovation (small ‘i’), it’s not my style to indulge in Innovation theatre (big ‘i’). Dave Rogers wrote a timely post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@daverog/why-hype-technology-is-killing-innovation-84151c62a18b&quot;&gt;why hype technology is killing innovation&lt;/a&gt; and got the message across much better than I could, I strongly recommend everyone read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the presentation’s final revision, I came across this part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy&quot;&gt;Government Transformation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (my highlighting):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will transform government services and make government itself a digital organisation so that citizens, businesses and other users have &lt;strong&gt;a better, more coherent experience&lt;/strong&gt; when interacting with government services - one that meets &lt;strong&gt;the raised expectations set by the many other (non-government) services and tools they use every day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me feel better about what we were exploring, so I went big on selling that vision not the specific technology. It has made it easier to sleep at night and consider how we might frame any eventual user research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;how we use OKRs&lt;/a&gt; and syndicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/how-we-use-okrs-on-gov-uk-1a8ac8be7eba&quot;&gt;the content on Medium&lt;/a&gt;. It has been doing well on Medium with over 1,000 views since I posted it, but only 11 per cent of traffic has come from Medium itself. The rest has come from a couple of tweets (by others, not me) and posts on news boards (by me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s proven the worth of leaving Medium to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1099056242306236417&quot;&gt;make the web personal again&lt;/a&gt;, driving value to your blog not Medium’s platform. To that end, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611805/the-four-ways-that-ex-internet-idealists-explain-where-it-all-went-wrong/&quot;&gt;Internet idealist&lt;/a&gt; in me added a link to my blog’s RSS feed in the top navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That some times you need to wield the vision to carry things forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some strong phrases edited out of my presentation, so I could probably do with learning a bit of diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These weeknotes took me 1.5 hours to write on a Monday evening and I added some final tweaks on Tuesday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How we use OKRs on GOV.UK</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives and key results (OKRs) is a simple tool to create measurable goals for agile teams. It provides a framework for defining objectives, how teams will achieve those outcomes, and tracking their progress. It’s a light-touch way of setting goals and focus. It was originally developed by Andy Grove at Intel and has since been adopted by other product organisations such as Google, LinkedIn, Twitter and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we use OKRs on GOV.UK, the UK government’s website. Teams are trusted to deliver value for users, and this framework reduces tension between agile delivery professionals and senior management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-objective&quot;&gt;What is an objective?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An objective is a bold and qualitative goal that the company or organisation wants to achieve. For example, ‘Prepare the GOV.UK platform for the scale demands of Brexit’ or ‘Make it easier for users to start using our product’. It’s best that they’re ambitious, not easy to achieve or audacious in nature; they are not sales targets. These objectives make up your product strategy.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives are usually set by the CEO or Head of Product and set the direction for the company or programme. Objectives shouldn’t be dictatorial goals, they should be missions that every team member can buy in to and get behind. Because they’re ambitious, it’s not healthy to set deadlines for when a product team should achieve an objective. Since CEOs aren’t on the frontlines, they can’t accurately say how long it will take a team to reach a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives may be put on a roadmap and make up part of an organisation’s strategy for getting nearer to its vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-key-result&quot;&gt;What is a key result?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key result is a tangible and quantitative goal for how a product team will achieve an objective. For example ‘Benchmark the speed and reliability of the publishing pipeline, improve it by 10%’ or ‘10% of new users will publish a document within 5 days of creating an account’. There may be one or many key results that contribute towards achieving an objective. It’s best that they’re specific, measurable, achievable and realistic, to help a team answer the questions ‘How will we reach the objective?’ and ‘How will we know when we’re done?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key results are usually set by the product team which helps them be objective about the scope and prioritisation of their goals. Teams shouldn’t be beholden to accomplishing a key result by a deadline or by a certain amount; they are not quotas, key deliverables or a list of tasks. Key results are lines in the sand that teams can reach in a healthy way, by not burning out. It’s possible to change a key result later down the line, and some teams often will as they get closer to understanding the problem. Since teams are on the frontlines, they’ll often be able to set more realistic key results as they mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key results are often made up of lots of little initiatives, epics to be pulled into sprints or a series of experiments to reach a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-okrs-look-like&quot;&gt;What do OKRs look like?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/okr-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;A template OKR slide&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the OKR template above to set objectives and key results for product teams on GOV.UK. You can copy this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M_k6LATfoNBkaAPLSV5ayrSo5weGD095H50gIW2d00M/&quot;&gt;open slide deck&lt;/a&gt; to use with your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-okrs-in-practice&quot;&gt;How to use OKRs in practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a product team starts a new mission, we add the objective to the template. We get together as a team and ask ourselves ‘What does success look like?’ This produces a set discovery and delivery goals&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to be reached, which usually shape our key results. Since the key results have been produced and agreed collectively by every team member, we have a shared view of how we’ll achieve the objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every fortnight a product team will meet with the GOV.UK programme team – senior management for the platform – and report on how they’re progressing. It’s also an opportunity to raise any risks they’ve come across or anything they need from the programme team. Meetings are light-touch and only take 30 minutes. Product teams have more time to spend solving problems, and the programme team can offer help where it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GOV.UK programme team may take the opportunity to set new objectives each quarter. It’s sensible to take a temperature check of work underway at regular intervals, in case there are new priorities. This also gives product teams a chance to play back to management their findings from a discovery, which means that some times the objective set is based entirely on the team’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reporting-confidence-and-progress&quot;&gt;Reporting confidence and progress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product teams will report how confident they feel in being able to achieve the objective, and teams will also report their progress in the discovery or delivery threads of their work. It’s a ‘finger in the air’ score to give the programme team a sense of how well they’re progressing. By taking this reading fortnightly, the programme team can see when confidence drops or progress halts, which is an opportunity for them to help the team remove blockers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good idea to check the team’s confidence during a sprint retrospective. You can work out the team’s progress by counting how many cards on the sprint board have been done and how many are left to do. It’s a simple method, and it’s OK for you to create more cards after some discovery work – that’s agile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-use-okrs&quot;&gt;Why use OKRs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s great about OKRs is that they pull top-down leadership together with bottom-up knowledge workers, giving them a space to communicate and reach a shared vision. They help everyone move together in the right direction, creating alignment between product teams in an organisation. It requires &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/27/product-teams-deliver-outcomes-not-outputs/&quot;&gt;a shift in mindset from outputs to outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Teams can understand how they’re contributing to the organisation’s strategy, and leadership can better set realistic short-term goals. Product teams are inspired and empowered to deliver value in interesting ways, and leadership can foster a culture of determination, boldness and psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting OKRs can expose some discomfort and issues you might not have encountered before. But that’s a good thing, and working through problems brings people closer together. OKRs are an empowerment technique to give product teams clear problems to solve and the space to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are not an instant solution, nor are they designed to create perfect unity. Instead, they give space for leadership to set ambitious goals that teams can buy into, and the framework gives space for product teams to solve problems in creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenjmesser/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and let me know if there’s anything else which would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After writing this post, someone reached out to me and asked ‘What if all the objectives are too grand and unattainable?’ to which we found out that their leadership didn’t have a product strategy. If objectives are not clear or can’t realistically be worked on, this is a fault of leadership. I’ll write a little more on what to do about that soon. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A few people have asked me whether they should set and report key results in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works&quot;&gt;discovery phase&lt;/a&gt; for a new product or service, and I’d say no. Discoveries are projects in which you explore ideas and gather information to help you decide what to deliver. You might have a set of key tasks to do in a discovery, but the only key result is having a better idea for what to do next. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Shock to the System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This episode will be short, as I’m feeling ill and run down, and I want to go back to bed. Returning to work after a week away teaching product management was a shock to the system. The pace at work is so fast, so full-on, and it was a heavy week of context switching. Time for a rest and short weeknotes as a result, but it was a blinding week – very productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewed the excellent Simon Everest about personalisation. He’s a real gem. Also had an interview with Jen Allum on the same topic, and she’s cracking too. Plus I got to meet Emily Ackroyd properly for the first time, and she was just as enlightening on the subject. Suffice it to say that this piece of work is coming together well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had coffee on Tuesday morning with fellow weeknoter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_crmzchan_&quot;&gt;Coco&lt;/a&gt;. It was great fun and nice to see her again after the weeknotes meet-up in Bristol. We chatted about agile delivery stuff and her new role as a delivery manager, then dived into chatter about weeknotes. I brought up the highlighting thing that people do and she &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_crmzchan_/status/1095249417379217408&quot;&gt;validated some assumptions&lt;/a&gt; as to how people use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was fun. More of that, please. Who else fancies morning coffee chats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a big decision and my team-mates on Search Resilience &amp;amp; Performance started building GOV.UK’s first fully cloud native backend service. It will mean&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we don’t need to upgrade Elasticsearch any more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can instead spend that time on feature work, making GOV.UK a more unique experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we save about £100,000 over the next couple of years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can switch to another hosting supplier whenever’s clever because we’re using open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More updates on that as my awesome team proceeds. They’ve done a phenomenal amount in the last 4–5 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went and met Frances at the BBC to chat about personalisation on iPlayer. Wow, that was a useful talk. Also got to nerd out on product stuff: North Star metrics for products and how those tie into the organisation’s mission and One Metric That Matters. I’m going to have to return to talk to her about that, I’ve always thought we could do with something similar for GDS. But who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoke to Mari in the Finnish government about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suomi.fi/etusivu/&quot;&gt;how they do personalisation&lt;/a&gt;. They were surprised that we were asking, because they follow what GDS does in so many areas. So it’s starting to feel like there’s some opportunity bubbling up but it’s not wholly concrete yet. It’s also going to need some incredible strategic navigation and, hands up, I’m not amazing at that (yet). So I’m meeting up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomskitomski&quot;&gt;Tom Loosemore&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of GDS, on Monday to steal some of his wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That despite a few weeks doing what felt like nothing, we’re finally making the right progress. It’s OK to generative research and it’s best that you don’t rush it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not working too hard when I’m feeling ill but, to be honest, I’m doing that now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a fuller list of things I looked at last week on my newsletter archive, the latest episode was about &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/stevenjmesser/letters/there-s-no-such-thing-as-government-big-tech-brother-and-data-guardians&quot;&gt;there being no such thing as government, Big Tech/Brother, and data guardians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/web-developer-tara-vancil-on-exploring-how-to-be-online-in-radical-ways/&quot;&gt;On exploring how to be online in radical ways&lt;/a&gt;, 16 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These weeknotes took me twenty-five minutes to write on a Saturday morning. It usually takes me much longer, but I’m feeling ill and haven’t gone into much detail or reflection. I often write these on a Saturday morning though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Birthday</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I celebrated my first anniversary at Government Digital Service. When the days are long and the work is hard, it’s easy to get dismayed, but that’s when I pinch myself to remember that I work on the UK government’s website. Next week I’m on leave, heading over to General Assembly to teach on their product management course, which is always fun. Means I might have the headspace to write up those blog posts I’ve been meaning to for ages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first team retro for Search Performance &amp;amp; Resilience went well. We’re clearly on the right track – it was a very positive session – and we have made the uncertain more certain early on, but we exposed issues around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine&quot;&gt;dev VM&lt;/a&gt;. Our developers have to download a lot of data to emulate www.gov.uk on their virtual machines, which means they often run out of disk space, but this problem is compounded when you’re having to load large search indexes too. It’s a programme-wide problem and we’re not the only team facing this issue, but it is more acute for our developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d heard word that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cbaines&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; had developed a way to take a slice of the data, meaning you needn’t load everything, but weren’t entirely sure the scripts existed. He had previously put together mini-environments though and I asked whether we could explore that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked whether we might be moving too fast, as I didn’t want us to miss any important details, but everyone thought were moving at a fine speed. This was improved later in the week when meeting the AWS Migration team. They were planning on migrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/rummager&quot;&gt;Rummager&lt;/a&gt;, our search API, but have had to focus on other parts of the infrastructure. Our roadmaps align though and they should be ready to help us route traffic from dependencies to the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/search-api&quot;&gt;Search API&lt;/a&gt; once it’s up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally I filled in a massive, gigantic spreadsheet charting our costs for search functionality over the next three years. As Liz Sarginson, our deputy director for Technical Operations, said: ‘Product managers should know the costs and financial effects of their decisions.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re getting a programme-wide roadmap put together, and I shaped how we might improve our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_pipeline&quot;&gt;product pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. Currently we have support tickets lumped in with feedback and feature requests, which means we’re mixing together the ‘I want to report a broken thing’ tickets with the ‘I want to know how to do a thing’ tickets. And the ‘I want to be able to do a new thing’ tickets get barely any time spent exploring the problem area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposal is to look into our current models for support, ongoing user testing, feedback and triage, aiming to quanitfy the operations and expose the pain points. We need to collect qualitative data on how this has been handled at other organisations and agencies, and I’ve some experience of doing this at NOW TV and Porism. (My pipeline for eCasework was really slick and meant our user retention went up, because user felt like they were being listened to.) We’re in need of a good knowledge base too, or at least some rules around making sure it’s updated. Too much of our product knowledge is stored up in people’s heads, which is not helpful when new people join the programme or move across product areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I’d like to look at how we work more closely with departments and end users, the next layer of the gumball: collecting and validating user needs, lean testing and research models, onsite observation for innovation, guerilla UX testing and other methods for improving our new product development. How do we best become aware of signals from users and ensure we don’t miss opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We held the first Product People LDN of 2019. Four people working in agile delivery teams spoke about their experiences working on EU Exit projects, with some excellent highlights. Move user research closer to policy, meaning it’s shaped based on real user need. Don’t force an MVP to be ready by a deadline, you’ll almost certainly miss the real and huge opportunities to create efficiences across government. Keep your cool about you and use your agile nous. Focus on purpose in a noisy context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who made it over to Whitechapel, to the speakers for their time, and to my colleagues for helping me hand out passes, direct people to room, etc. It’s such a good cross-government community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you missed out on the event, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Akj8MfT6PyV3FMPqcKVKjTyP0l5fp60Kyo869y5cApU/edit&quot;&gt;view the presentations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a playback session for the Explore Personalisation mission. We’ve just started turning over the rocks to find out what’s beneath, interviewing other organisations, international governments and others to explore this area. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mhurrell.co.uk&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; starting putting together some excellent desk research on the rise and fall of personalisation on other Web platforms. I pestered people at Facebook, Netflix and elsewhere to talk to us, but no dice so far. I did a little vomit because Facebook refers to itself as &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2006/09/facebook-launches-additional-privacy-controls-for-news-feed-and-mini-feed/&quot;&gt;‘the Internet’s leading social utility’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve lost our delivery manager to EU Exit projects, so I’ll try and keep the ship sailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatted to Fajer about GOV.UK Registers. I was delighted to hear that she’d been enthused by meeting folks at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Transport. It sounds like she can see the opportunities for taking Registers to the next level, helping pin together some of the fabulous efforts the open data community in government is already realising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it’s like navigating a team through ambiguity. Exploring a nebulous problem area isn’t easy, especially when it is ill-defined and not related to goals. But having a wide-enough scope to uncover glimmers of the possible is one of the ways we can innovate (little ‘i’). Grateful to John for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/15-things-you-should-know-about-product-managers-f488513d246&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; reminding me that being at the centre of the tornado is the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a couple of hours, split over a few days, to put together the gigantic costs spreadsheet for Search Resilience &amp;amp; Performance. It kept popping up in stand-up, unfinished, so I could perhaps be better at carving out time for large pieces of work like that. Maybe I should have a logbook of how long certain tasks usually take, that’d be helpful in planning my week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the people who’ve signed up to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; this week, I’m really glad to hear people think it’s a ‘great collection of stories’!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These weeknotes took me two and a half hours to write on a Saturday morning. It always takes me that long, and I often do it on a Saturday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Reminder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A mammoth set of weeknotes, but ending with a note to enthuse everyone working in civic technology. There was a lot of switching and changing this week, jumping from one team meeting to another, and then into programme-level meetings for our wider strategy. We also had our first check-in meetings so a ton happened this week. On Friday I left work feeling like I hadn’t achieved everything I needed to, but on reflection it seems OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN STUFF:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve organised a &lt;a href=&quot;https://attending.io/events/weeknotes-meetup-ldn&quot;&gt;meetup for weeknoters in London&lt;/a&gt;, please do come along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met up with Peter, Head of Performance &amp;amp; Data Analysis on GOV.UK, to chat about metadata, vocabularies, Directgov, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.esd.org.uk/support/solutions/articles/5000380060-where-can-i-find-the-latest-integrated-public-sector-vocabulary-ipsv-&quot;&gt;Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; and other things that my time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://porism.com&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt; got me unexpectedly excited about. It came off the back of Kit and Robin’s post about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/15/help-us-start-a-data-revolution-for-government/&quot;&gt;data revolution in government&lt;/a&gt;, which the seasoned amongst us would recognise as the latest in a long line of calls to action. That’s not to say it’s not still needed though, and I’m keen to think about ways we can show the value of this work, allowing senior stakeholders to put some moolah behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice to find an ally in Peter, one of many people I’ve been pleased to learn has an appreciation for data categorisation schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas-vs-business-model-canvas-af62c0f250f0&quot;&gt;lean canvas&lt;/a&gt; session with Paola, Content Product Lead on GOV.UK. I did my Jared Dunn bit and broke out the business tools. She’s been thinking about structured data for content on GOV.UK for some time, so I wanted to get her ideas down in a way that would allow us to test the assumptions. We’re pretty sure that adding structured data to content is a Good Thing, but we need to validate that it is a Good Thing. The lean canvas helps us break down the overall idea into specific tactical areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/C8CupnJmXXqSuxlPOX/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Jared Dunn pulls a SWOT analysis board from behind a cabinet. From HBO's Silicon Valley.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I asked her to start detailing the solution, what the thing was. She came up with four facets of the product: a tool to build and edit concept schemes and vocabularies, a tool to break up content and tag it, a contextual content API, and something else which I can’t remember. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Next I asked her to list the problems that would solve, and we jotted down a heap of ideas. We then worked through the rest of the canvas, finally settling on ‘Revenue streams’ which I changed to ‘Value for government’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have an understanding of what this thing might be, the problems it would solve, how it would solve those problems, the people who’d use it soonest and later, the cost to research and build this thing, etc. But everything we’ve listed is an assumption. The next step is to validate whether our assumptions are true or not. For example, we assumed that duplicating content was a problem this would solve. We need to dig into this problem area and collect evidence that a) it is a problem, b) it is a problem of unorganised and unfindable content, and b) it is a problem big enough to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent a few hours with James, delivery manager on the Explore Personalisation work, drawing up an initial roadmap for the quarter. We broke down everything we needed to learn in order to write a report, what would likely go in to the report, and how we’d learn what we needed to know. This gave us the bones from which we could set some milestones, which really are essential for a nebulous piece of work like this. It was hugely valuable to get everything out of our heads and onto a sheet we could put in front of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paid off in the planning session later, as we were able to get the team aligned on the goals and add more detail to the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with people from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to see their new service to register a food business (currently in private beta) and its overlap with GOV.UK Licensing’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/food-business-registration&quot;&gt;food business registration&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a better user experience than the journey on GOV.UK, and it ties into local authority backend systems through an API (if needed) which is a huge improvement for councils. They were quick to place blame on us for broken journeys though, which made things more tense than they needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to understand how their service would improve on our shortcomings and they explained how the service worked. I identified that the switching cost for councils would be low, as the hand-off to councils was identical to GOV.UK Licensing – and improved if a council used the FSA service’s API. As a result, I suggested we work together to explain this to councils and encourage more to move to the FSA’s service. The details need to be worked out and journeys for all parties considered, but the main thing is that we make it better for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also gave me an opportunity to pick their brains about open data, which they didn’t know much about, but I’m hoping the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jargonautical&quot;&gt;Lucy Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drsiant&quot;&gt;Sian Thomas&lt;/a&gt; will extol the virtues to them. Being able to see the number of new food business registrations by LSOA each month (or something) would be really useful, because one day I’d like to use that to start a food business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had fun hosting an Ask Me Anything with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncutlefish&quot;&gt;John Cutler&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, and the other product managers at GDS seemed to enjoy it too. He spoke about tons of stuff. He really is a goldmine of product management skills, techniques and information, and he’s great at providing analogies for what he’s describing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;highlights&quot;&gt;Highlights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Martin for writing these up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be wary of just being reactive to things – this is the biggest mistake you can make as a PM.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s an anti-pattern to be myopic on things. You can’t only focus on the detail of a problem area, you must also know its context and the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the reality in the room when stakeholders make grand assumptions about solutions, ask them to break down how the outcome could be reached.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People nod their head at certain terms but might not share the same understanding. For example, MVP is thrown around at GDS (and the rest of government) but how many people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; understand what it means? Get definitions on a poster and out in the open to spark conversation. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping is a power dynamic – be aware of that. In telling someone how to improve their ways of working, you’re also telling them that what they do now sucks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present thinking rather than gap thinking is probably better for organisational change. The latter is based on aiming for a massive far-off goal. The former is more about iterating within the present possibility space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re a new PM on an established product, create a learning backlog for yourself. Get a prioritised set of questions to help you learn about the product and its vision. Pull them into your team’s backlog so they can answer stuff for you, it builds trust. Be clear on why you’re asking the questions as well, to help people understand your strategic approach to discovery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell the opportunity rather than the intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about uncertainty with certainty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/&quot;&gt;HiPPOs&lt;/a&gt; to frame their idea as a [testable] bet that you’ll hold them accountable to. Then reflect back when you see the outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start together. Open up the door to the haunted house together. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One comment gave everyone in the room a good boost. He said, ‘You’re solving some of the hardest problems in the world, you know, you’re not delivering a burrito by drone – that’s just an optimisation problem! You guys are doing the coolest shit in the world.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it feels like we’re sailing through a storm near jagged rocks, but we’re still sailing. We’re still doing good stuff. Remember that, people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of early-stage team roadmaps, even just for a quarter. Getting your initial thoughts out onto a board is really quite valuable, helping you set the structure of nebulous missions. They’re an excellent artifact to talk over with users, but this was my first time having a proper stab at one with a team. Really thankful tht James persisted with this and got us started on one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with challenging statements. It’s hard not to seem defensive when you’re explaining the reason for things being crap, but I’d like to learn how to be better at unpicking difficult people and getting them onside.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Navigation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Quarter four, 2018–19, is launched. Work scoped, backlogs filled, sprints begun. We pace ahead on GOV.UK. It’s been a really enjoyable week and, despite one blip, pretty easy-going. I’ve had to wrangle my calendar a little and so, in the spirit of being open, feel free to grab some time to chat about anything: &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/steve-messer/&quot;&gt;during work hours&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;in the evening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone heading to UKGovCamp today, I hope you have tons of fun. Sad to be missing out but it’s my girlfriend’s birthday and needs must. To all weeknoters, old and new, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doodle.com/poll/97gbxrfms83wtf9b&quot;&gt;put your name down if you fancy a weeknotes meet-up in London&lt;/a&gt;. And I’m having a crack at publishing a newsletter, so check the Reading section for details on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new team, Search Performance &amp;amp; Resilience, kicked off the quarter! We’re looking at three specific problems in the problem space: our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; is out-of-support and needs upgrading; managing our clusters is costly on time and takes us away from feature work; and knowledge of Elasticsearch is low throughout the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our small but excellent team started by getting Elasticsearch 5.x and 6.x running on their local machines, importing data and noting the differences. This couldn’t have been done without the clear and detailed notes that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/katstevens&quot;&gt;Kat&lt;/a&gt; left us before Christmas, so we’ve a card on our backlog to say thanks to her. Having picked out the breaking changes between v2.x, v5.x and v6.x, we’re working out a plan for jumping to the latter version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve each acknowledged the blazing fast pace we’ve had this week, it’s a great feeling getting up to speed on the landscape so quickly. But once we get into the meaty work, I’ll be mindful to mention how we can’t always move fast. Tricky technical work deserves some thinking space, so metering everyone’s expectations upfront should hopefully mean no one laments slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main key result: performance and resilience is not degraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other new team, Explore Personalisation, also kicked off the quarter! Our initial meeting provided us with a bunch of questions to answer, to help us work out the unknowns. Getting a feel for the problem space is one of the essential first steps for a product team, so we’ve lots of interviews and desk research lined up. As mentioned before, I’ll not go into too much detail on this work as it’s sensitive and we’ll be blogging about it (plus publishing our research for others to use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product managing this work is important for me because, up until now, I’ve been on a very technical product team at GDS. This is a discovery with myriad possibilities, many loud opinions both in the team and battering us from external stakeholders, and balances vision leadership with the current climate around privacy ethics. My history on Platform Health risks me being pigeonholed as a technical product manager and, whilst I’m not afraid of getting into that complex work, this is a chance to showcase my other skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled out some questions to help us start forming a roadmap for core products. That’s mostly the applications in the publishing pipeline, authentication, other backends and some cross-product experiences that don’t sit elsewhere. As GOV.UK continues to scale, taking on more government bodies, publishers and serving more people, it’s going to need a bit of operationalisation and programme-wide strategy. For example, if our Publishing product group want to start doing fancy new things, we’ll need to guide them based on what’s possible now and where the overall platform is headed. We need to build up some data, research our colleagues and form a vision for where we’re headed in the coming weeks – that’s for next week though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned how techniques for dealing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/&quot;&gt;HiPPOs&lt;/a&gt; don’t always work. People whose bread and butter is making demands can’t be reasoned with during tense moments. This is where knowledge work rubs up against authority bias, where evidence and lean methods lose out to solutionism and senior demands. It’s bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in unprecedented times and who’s to say that one way is the best to navigate through? It might be the case that features based on little evidence work, though I’ve not seen that happen often. People with a high degree of domain knowledge can often make instinctive decisions that turn out to be successes – Steve Jobs was great at this. But it’s hard to make reasoned, objective decisions in domains where one has very little knowledge of the intricacies and the environment. Strong product teams exist ‘to serve the [users], in ways that meet the needs of the [organisation]’, as Marty Cagan says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/empowered-product-teams/&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt;, and they don’t operate well under ‘command and control’ management. So what does work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to be paired with more of our excellent delivery managers this quarter, which has allowed me to experience some new delivery styles and learn a couple of facilitation methods. I’ll cover those in the post I’ve promised about how to kick off agile delivery teams and credit both Lee and James. Here’s thanks to them for this week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling myself out for snapping in a meeting, which is the first time I’ve done it at GDS. I was angry that our methods aren’t respected and colleagues were pushed against a wall, but that doesn’t make it OK. To be honest, almost every single meeting I’ve been in at GDS has been fine, nothing like the heated conversations you read about in other organisations, both public and private. I’d prefer to keep it that way though, so here’s to metering my own emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Cross</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Firebreak week, a time to make things better and get ready for next quarter. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1082944581472264192&quot;&gt;Platform Health sticker arrived&lt;/a&gt; too, which was bleeding great. Proud to have played a part in such an important mission of maintenance, glad they’re continuing on. Expect a post from Martin on why the team was set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s painting is completely unrelated to the week I had. It’s what it looked like at the end of my road in 1850.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/local-links-manager&quot;&gt;Local Links Manager&lt;/a&gt; is a tool we use at GOV.UK to maintain and update links to services on local authority websites. It was built quickly and is a good minimum viable product (MVP), but this week it needed a little more refinement work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down with our Content Support team to take notes on their process, picking out the main pain points and where we could add value. By far the biggest time-hog was local authorities spending up to two months to return a spreadsheet with updated links. That’s likely because they were sent a CSV with 60,000 rows! So our first improvement was to add a button allowing teams to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/local-links-manager/pull/363&quot;&gt;download broken links for a council&lt;/a&gt;. This should mean that councils don’t need to filter the sheet they’re sent, it’s more easily workable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big time-hog was updating links. This is done manually by Content Support amongst all their other work, it can take an entire day if they focus solely on updating links. This could be solved with an import feature, allowing them to upload a CSV of changed links, reducing their time spent on updating links to a couple of minutes. Unfortunately, due to illness, we didn’t have enough dev time to get this built but I’m hoping my good friends on Platform Health will consider taking it on – it’s a small card and a big plus for our operations budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Links Manager is a good example of an MVP needing time to bed down before being iterated. The product was viable, but minimally so, and over the last 18 months of functioning well the areas for improvement became more apparent. It’s a lesson in giving products time to settle down, in beta and live phases. Once the gleam of newness has dulled, areas to be iterated will naturally appear from the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are looking good for the product community on GOV.UK. We got together with Leanne, Head of Product, to look at how we’re going to approach the year and a strategy will emerge in the next few weeks. We’ve been encouraged to come up with visions and strategies for our areas of the platform, and to be entrepreneurial in how we seek and justify new opportunities. I found this really invigorating as I’ve got some decent ideas on what could be done, so knowing there’s time to validate these and present cases for doing the work is really valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handed the translations work over to Adam, the new associate product manager on Platform Health. He joined GDS three months ago and I’ve been buddying with him since he joined, as he was a Fast Streamer hired as a developer and put into a product role. He’s been devouring the resources and reading, and I was really impressed by his questions about the translation work and how he handled getting more information from our developers. He’s gonna do pretty well, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started putting together the objectives for my two missions this quarter: search performance and resilience, and exploring personalisation. I’ve been blessed with a good team on both fronts, and my delivery managers Lee and James both sent over slide decks for our kick-off meetings. I added some background info, details on the problem space and called out our objective on both decks, giving us time during the rest of the session to ask questions, work out what we know, set up an initial backlog and agree some key results as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did start writing that guide I promised in &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website/2018/12/21/the-winter-solstice/&quot;&gt;S02E09&lt;/a&gt; on how to get teams started, but I’ll add what we get up this quarter too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with civic tech legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psd&quot;&gt;Paul Downey&lt;/a&gt;. He’s come up with some absolute classics that you’ll recognise: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psd/status/568324759521501184&quot;&gt;the difference between waterfall and agile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/30/just-doodling-telling-the-story-with-a-few-pen-strokes/&quot;&gt;doodles about technology and teams&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.registers.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Registers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/8451589322/in/album-72157633230231221/&quot;&gt;the unit of delivery is the team&lt;/a&gt;. So he’s a bit of a celebrity and I was really grateful he took time to chat with me. We spoke about open data (of course), some GOV.UK history, Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson, and what it’s like working with senior stakeholders. That last bit was hugely valuable for me – probably the most valuable five minutes in recent weeks. If you, dear reader, would like to advise me on how to work well with Big Wigs, please get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was the first time I’ve observed the delta of seniority. I was gifted wisdom from someone senior to me, and it was useful. But the teaching I’ve tried to give someone junior to me has, seemingly, paid off in part. I’ve never been a line manager before but would certainly be interested now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a bit meeting-logged on Monday. Too many short meetings that took the entire half an hour, not giving me enough time to work my notes into something sensible. So I could do better at giving myself buffer time between meetings. That’s hard when people demand your time through Google Calendar and it doesn’t support buffer time. Maybe there’s something on Zapier I could use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Limbo Continues</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re still in the fallow period, but it has been a boon: loose ends tied, histories written, new ships prepared for departure. Writing reviews of 2018 has been popular this week, and I’ve enjoyed reading pieces by new weeknoters. This weekend I’ll try to find the time to have a little retro of these first two series of my weeknotes, make the most of the continuing limbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Three Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the quarter has already ended and this week demanded nothing urgent (for a change), I spent a day continuing to document the last three months. This consisted of going through the Trello board, picking out the cards related to our OKRs, i.e. not business-as-usual cards to support the platform, and writing up a narrative on Confluence telling future colleagues what we did, why, and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t rewrite the details of the cards on Confluence, simply linked to the cards, because that would have taken hours. That troubled me because – as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonodrew&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; pointed out – Trello isn’t a permanent record of anything. Hopefully it will persist in the immediate future but it’s certainly time to look at writing product decision records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to users is an important aspect of good product work, as is talking to your team. This week I spoke with two users – a local authority and HM Courts &amp;amp; Tribunals Service (HMCTS) – about some issues they’d had; and Bruce, tech lead on the upcoming search work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually contact with users would be handled over email but it’s not always an ideal communication channel. I’ve used phone calls in my previous role to quickly catch up with users, it’s more immediate, and it tends improve our rapport with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, it’s a great way to open up your pipeline for new work. Emails can be very direct, whereas verbal conversations cover more ground. For example, I was able to find out how HMCTS use one of our publishing tools, the steps they take, why they use that process and the steps they take in other similar workflows – all inside 5 minutes. That meant I was able to address their issue immediately and gather useful context to consider improvements. It’s not always possible or necessary, granted, but quick contact would help lubricate our support processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a chat with Bruce to field any questions was great too. When he first requested the meeting, I made sure to pull together everything we’d already done and make it available to him. He took a read through and said he felt really good about it, as we’ve had much of the work shaped by Kat from Digital Marketplace who’s upgraded Elasticsearch before. Considering we were rather in the dark three months ago, we’re in a really strong position now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also caught up with Leanne, Head of Product for GOV.UK, about the discovery into personalisation we’re doing in the upcoming quarter. I’ll not speak about that on my weeknotes as I’m intending to blog about it regularly. I’d also like us to publish the research and reports openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, etc. It works. Although perhaps I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/10-product-development-traps-2de02bc358bd&quot;&gt;overestimating the alignment from one meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pitching my firebreak session, someone raised a challenge and I replied with a stumbled ‘Errr…’. I think I should compose myself more during those moments, I’m afraid I looked shook.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fallow Period</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A short week at work, being only Christmas Eve and one day of The Gooch – the bit between Christmas and New Year that’s a bit empty but definitely has purpose. Spent most of it either wrapping up the quarter or walking in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gojauntly.app.link/FJdpLwifZS?_p=f34a264cea2ade7e638208&quot;&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; and Wales (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gojauntly.app.link/il3YL5Yf1S?_p=f34a264cea2ade7e638208&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1079046602940141568&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Two Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this (though it was only a 2-day week)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there will be a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/associate-product-manager-skills-they-need/associate-product-manager-skills-they-need&quot;&gt;associate product manager&lt;/a&gt; replacing me on Platform Health, I spent a few hours packaging up a project I’d made a start on but can’t continue. Translations on GOV.UK give departments the ability to share information in languages other than English, which due to the platform’s organic growth isn’t a function that’s handled consistently by the various publishing applications. Since we have a few issues with translations to be solved, it’s worthwhile looking at how we can make it better everywhere rather than fixing bit-part problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be a good first project for them to sink their teeth into, a meaty technical problem – allowing them to explore the stack and the idiosyncracies of applications – which can be fixed by focusing on delivering value to users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs&quot;&gt;Starting with user needs&lt;/a&gt; will mean they can check on whether we’ve delivered enough for users already, as this hasn’t been looked at holistically before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote up what we’d managed to achieve this quarter and it’s quite a bit. There had been a few headline metrics such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/11/28/making-sure-users-see-updates-caching/&quot;&gt;making content appear 10x sooner for users&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the publishing queues by 45 per cent and improving publishing latency by 25 per cent. But after digging into our metrics a little more, the improvements haven’t been wholly consistent and there’s still a few fluctuations to take account of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that the team hasn’t been successful. Though we set ourselves the task of improving the publishing pipeline, we don’t own it and the actions of other teams have influence on it. We’ve been successful in finding root causes and addressing those through code, but it’s time to take a look at some principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regret not having been able to set service level objectives (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@asuffield/thinking-about-slos-64841737d1ed&quot;&gt;SLOs&lt;/a&gt;) for the user experience on GOV.UK. It was my main aim at the beginning of the quarter but holiday and urgent EU Exit projects got in the way. It started off with a prioritisation of Jobs-to-be-Done on GOV.UK and setting SLOs for scheduling publications, but the body of work needs to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t get precious about the effect of your code on shared infrastructure. It’s better to be precious about the principles you set for everyone who shares it. One to run past &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.probablyfine.co.uk/about.html&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; when we next have coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a 2-day week, it’s hard to improve on answering emails and writing up organisation knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading List Picks of 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a heck of a year. I got to fulfill a teenage dream and start working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk&quot;&gt;an important and much-used website&lt;/a&gt;, which got me thinking about product management, people, work and the World Wide Web more than  I did last year. Here’s a bunch of articles and blog posts that piqued my interest throughout 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-build-a-low-tech-website&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-tech Magazine looks at the sustainability of the modern world and its practices. They decided to practice what they preach by making their website run entirely on solar power, using web design techniques to reduce energy consumption and a self-built solar power bank to run it all – no data centres and CDNs in sight. Though it occasionally goes offline when there’s not enough power, the article really got me thinking about the ‘always on’ nature of the Web and how that’s quite wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bullshit-web&quot;&gt;The Bullshit Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to Low-tech Magazine, Nick Heer wrote about the ballooning bullshit of data on the Web and the wastefulness of filling your 17MB/s internet connection with ads. It’s an essay on what the Web was meant to be, and what it has become; and how the Information Superhighway could benefit from those of us working on it to take more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/&quot;&gt;The Bullshit Web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cognition-crisis&quot;&gt;The Cognition Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up and checking your phone. Scrolling through Facebook while the telly’s on. Notifications causing drivers to kill people. Adam Gazzaley argues that ‘our constant engagement with technology interferes with the pursuit of other behaviors critical for maintaining a healthy mind’, and it caused me to turn on Do Not Disturb when at work. We have natural animal minds that are being pushed to the edge by the environment we’ve built around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/the-cognition-crisis-a1482e889fcb&quot;&gt;The Cognition Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-principles-that-make-me-a-better-product-manager&quot;&gt;The principles that make me a better product manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that’s central to the practice of product management, it’s a set of principles one can call on in any situation. A good principle can keep everyone on course but also help point the way forward in unfamiliar waters. Ross Ferguson left us with seven principles before he was poached by the Canadians, and they’ve really helped me in my first year at Government Digital Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rossferg/the-principles-that-make-me-a-better-product-manager-9e50814d184f&quot;&gt;The principles that make me a better product manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking-about-slos&quot;&gt;Thinking about SLOs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out how to maintain and operate a behemoth like GOV.UK was pretty daunting when I joined Platform Health. Adopting a Service Level Objective and thinking about how we manage technical solutions from a users-first perspective has been massively helpful. I’m really grateful that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilylabram&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; posted this by Andrew Suffield – one-time Site Reliability Engineer at Google – and for all her work on spreading SLO thinking at GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teams-from-scratch--part-1-psychological-safety&quot;&gt;Teams from Scratch – Part 1: Psychological Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a culture where asking questions and admitting gaps in knowledge is OK can be hard, but this piece popped up serendipitously around the time I was doing a lot of thinking on team-building. It turned out that Alex worked at Unruly, an adtech company which shares our office building, and we’ve been meeting for coffee ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@probablyfine/teams-from-scratch-part-1-psychological-safety-ea43d46cdbc6&quot;&gt;Teams from Scratch – Part 1: Psychological Safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-privacy-come-to-be-enshrined-as-a-human-right&quot;&gt;How did privacy come to be enshrined as a human right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this year of our Lord, 2018, when the General Data Protection Regulation was enshrined in law, no doubt many of us were thinking &lt;em&gt;Why on earth are we going through all this pain?&lt;/em&gt; Preparing for GDPR was a huge undertaking, and despite the boring spreadsheets and confusing issues around compliance, I think it’s largely a Good Thing. This series by Projects by IF traces the history of our right to privacy and the role of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microdosing-isnt-a-shortcut-to-professional-success&quot;&gt;Microdosing Isn’t a Shortcut to Professional Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being employed in Tech, with working weeks called ‘sprints’, can often feel like you’re &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; running a race, and open plan offices can dwindle your focus. Some people turn to microdosing – taking small amounts of psychoactive drugs – to find a balance, but Erica Avey argues that perhaps we should change the way we work, not our biology. This article applies to coffee as much as it does to LSD, in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weeknotes-styles&quot;&gt;Weeknotes styles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I started writing weeknotes, a weekly reflection on my working week, and I’ve found the practice really beneficial. It’s like a personal retrospective, giving you a chance to package up the week and move on, making improvements. I recommend it to a lot of people I meet, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stamanfar&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; wrote this piece on the different styles the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;Web of Weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; community uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknote-styles-61d957e58a4a&quot;&gt;Weeknotes styles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-isnt-for-everyone&quot;&gt;This isn’t for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most when I joined GDS was that many of our products didn’t have defined user personas. Nor did we say who we wouldn’t build things for. Not all users are equal. The mindset of building for everyone is helpful in not excluding certain groups, but it can widen the scope of a product too much. The Parliament Data team, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fantasticlife&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; in particular, have been good in acknowledging that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;democratic-technical-debt&quot;&gt;Democratic technical debt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital government has surged forth leaving improved services in its wake. But how much of the enhancements are only surface-deep? ‘If you don’t consider what the long term impact of how you build something is, you’re accruing democratic technical debt,’ author Alex Blandford says. While also positing that terrific idea, Alex also points out that, well, government has been a bit shit at providing the research it has conducted. A few blog posts ain’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-personal-resilience-or-how-to-avoid-burnout&quot;&gt;Building personal resilience (or how to avoid burnout)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been hectic, and it’s possible for work to become all-consuming if you’re not careful. What helped me avoid that was to draw a line between my professional and personal lives: I used weeknotes to package up the week, and I used personal time to replenish my mind and soul. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pippapeasland&quot;&gt;Pippa&lt;/a&gt; takes a great perspective on how to do that in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;targeted-advertising-is-ruining-the-internet-and-breaking-the-world-and-we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites&quot;&gt;Targeted Advertising Is Ruining the Internet and Breaking the World, and We Should Replace Facebook With Personal Websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, I stopped using Facebook to see whether I’d miss it. It wasn’t a problem at all, in fact there’s not a single feature I longed for, so I deleted my account. That’s mostly been driven by their abysmal record for privacy in recent months and their involvement in the Cambridge Analytica atrocity. I’ve read countless articles on Facebook this year, but these two stand out. One shows us how advertising has been a misplaced driver for social media firms, and the other reminds us how the Web worked before the 2.0 giants took over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-how-we-workgive-or-take&quot;&gt;This is how we work…give or take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Matt Jukes&lt;/a&gt; is a legend of the civic tech space, a dynamo of humble magnificence with a Bristol accent – an honest, friendly, earnest kind of bloke. So of course he wrote an open piece on how he works, which caused people from all across the public sector (and others) to write one too. It’s a fascinating to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empowered-product-teams&quot;&gt;Empowered Product Teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post covers much of Marty Cagan’s talk when he visited us in September. It’s a long read but it’s absolutely essential for organisations scaling up, past the startup mindset. It reminds us that qualities of leadership can be better than management, and that great teams are full of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Winter Solstice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not a bad week to round off 2018, and Winter Solstice is the perfect day to look ahead. I’m going to be working over Christmas so this series hasn’t ended yet, but this week was definitely a major milestone. It’s time to tie off some loose ends and prepare for 2019, as next year will be hectic. Hopefully my weeknotes won’t suffer as a result but since &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;people who are busier and better than me&lt;/a&gt; manage it, I’ll always have them to turn to for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kicked off &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; new team, although not one that I’ll be managing from day to day. Its mission is to look at another of our key results in Platform Health, a particularly risky one around EU Exit, ensuring that we can handle a spike in departments publishing content concurrently. It’s a pretty complex space trying to work out the efficiencies of a distributed publishing pipeline of micro-services, but we made a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steventux&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; is Tech Lead which is perfect, as he’s an excellent full stack developer who has a deep knowledge of www.gov.uk and how it has evolved over time. After talking through the mission and setting an objective, I covered some of the cards we’d completed in other sprints, spikes into how we’d collect data on publishing activity and how we’d replay that to the pipeline. The biggest hurdle to overcome was figuring out how to replay fake publishing events, and Steve’s managed to use Gatling to do that. That’s a huge achievement and means the mission can actually progress now. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible. We’re not sure whether to use Gor or logs data to replicate publishing events but that’s something to look at next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably write a full guide on how I kick off a digital team in government. I’ve done it twice in the last three weeks, beyond the usual quarter kick-offs for Platform Health, and a few elements worked really well, so it’d be good to have those to turn to. No doubt others out there could add their tidbits too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deployed all the OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE stuff we’d been working on, so that people and businesses can find information on how exiting the EU will affect them. There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://euexit.campaign.gov.uk&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; which points to new content on www.gov.uk, all of which has been through rapid cycles of prototyping, user testing and iteration. A journalist put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1075701805521231873&quot;&gt;red-hot take&lt;/a&gt; that UK government was trying to catch up to the Dutch government, as the Dutch did a similar-but-not-the-same thing a few months ago, although the Dutch one spits out a PDF of information that could change. Ours, however, can be updated as policy develops and you can subscribe to email alerts about changes specific to your context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that aside, it’s testament to our ways of working and the value that GOV.UK provides that we’re able to design, build and release these useful tools and information inside of four weeks. It would have been released sooner had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46509288&quot;&gt;the vote on the deal in Parliament&lt;/a&gt; not been delayed. So ignoring the political situation and what we were delivering, it turns out that being lean and agile works for making stuff happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of that day, a day of team ceremonies and the EU Exit Deployathon, I had an interview. Having been worried about it last week, GDS came to their senses and scheduled an interview before Christmas. I made sure to talk about things I had done rather than what we had done as a team, because they called me out on that at HMRC. It went well, I bigged myself up, and they did tons of nodding. But mostly I’ll cherish having casually strolled into an interview during some important, stressful work. (I know that’s very egotistical but it is quite rare, let me bask in it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatted with other PMs and our new Head of Product, Leanne, about our missions for next quarter. I’m leaving my work-family, Platform Health, to start two new teams: Search &amp;amp; Finders Resilience, continuing the work we did on dynamic content performance; and Personalisation, looking at whether users want personalised experiences and how that might benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on Personalisation is going to be great. We’ve got the Head of User Insights, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Imeh_Akpan&quot;&gt;Imeh&lt;/a&gt;, and Senior Service Designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KateIW&quot;&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt;, working with us, two of the most talented folk on GOV.UK. Plus Leanne was massively involved in personalisation at Sky, so she’ll have some good ideas, but it’s working with stakeholders that I’m also really excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users have a mental model around giving government their personal data, which can largely be summarised by ‘ERM, NO F***ING WAY’. That’s going to be our first thing to explore, as it’s the major blocker to personalisation ever being a thing. Despite some senior civil servants, MPs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/the-smart-state/&quot;&gt;think tanks&lt;/a&gt; saying that GOV.UK needs this feature, we don’t much like spending taxpayers’ money on things they don’t need – so we’ll validate that first. On top of that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gansenthi&quot;&gt;Ganesh&lt;/a&gt; and I will be doing a side project on the Semantic Web and Linked Data, to get GOV.UK into the shape it really needs to be. If you’re reading this and I know you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you have worked on Semantic technologies in the past, expect to receive an email soon. (But if you’re a Semantic person and I don’t know you, please drop me a line!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s a little sad to be leaving Platform Health, I’m looking forward to working on a UX product after 9 months in the technical trenches. It’s going to be in good hands though, and they’ve got more complex work coming up that I can follow from the other side of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it turns out the interview went well. They offered me the promotion and I’m going to take it, because I really like working on that website. An early Christmas present!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That 2019 may be even more exciting and move more quickly than 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was absolutely fine, but I’m going to have to get anal about managing my time and focus. With so many plates to spin, I’ll need to work hard to make sure we meet all our objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Gift</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another sterling week working at pace on important problems. One of our senior product managers, Antonia, went on maternity leave this week and said she hoped I’d be around when she returned. I told her I probably would be: ‘Turning up to work is fun now, it’s not just a job.’ I am &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; lucky to be able to say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met our objective and finished the spin-up mission in 6 days. It’s a great achievement for everyone, especially pulling together in such a short space of time and, for much of the team, working on a new product. What was most impressive was how each person brought forward their own expertise, adding a unique and valuable facet to our research, testing and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we had three developers on the team, they covered hardware, computer science and creativity in code well. Our technical architect, Vitalie, was great in looking at the underlying, latent issues too, putting forward cards that prompted us to explore our support model. This was particularly great for me because I was about to ask him to do that, but he’d come about that slice of work through his own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first time working closely with a performance analyst too, which I really relished. Being able to ask product questions and getting evidence in return, evidence to support our endeavours, was fantastic. And my delivery manager, Nila, has been excellent in supporting the team and keeping things moving. She’s been so great that we’re going to see more of her next quarter. Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we hooked up with my other team, Platform Health, to run through some load-testing. We were really pleased to see that the three short-term optimisations we’d made had had an effect, allowing us to serve 400 unique users per second for 20 consecutive minutes. There’s still more to be done to work out when it’ll fall over, but we’ve removed the most immediate risk – the rest is just long-term optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen, Head of GOV.UK, raised a prescient point during one of our catch-ups. There’s been some trepidation in Government Digital Service about how the organisation will be treated in next year’s spending review, the worry being that we might have less budget to do more things. What we’ve been doing over the past few weeks, delivering beneficial work for the country at a considerable pace during an unprecedented period, has really impressed Cabinet Office (apparently) and Government as a whole to show them what we’re capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work has upheld the GDS principles and elements of the Service Standard, which just goes to prove the way we work and that transformation hasn’t finished, we’ve just entered a second age. We can all be really proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I had to give a firm ‘No’ to someone senior at GDS. It was a simple case of solutionising, really, and so quite easy to shift and redirect towards the desired outcome, but it’s uncommon to need to do it. They had proposed that a retention period should be applied to blog posts and that we could remove them after &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; years. That goes completely against the point of blogging in government and reeks of newspeak: we don’t alter history to make it fit the narrative we want to tell. We’re open, honest and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turned out they were just worried about GDPR compliance and ensuring that people could exercise their right to have personal data removed, which I found out after some digging. I explained the platform, how it works and why we have it, then showed how their different policies apply to different sections of the platform and blogging activity. They saw how to reach their outcome then, so we’re updating the privacy notice and internal HR policies. A good improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was a busy day with two interviews: one at HMRC, one phone interview at GDS. Both went really well, and I got along with everyone in the HMRC interview. Their work in London is particularly interesting, using product management practices to help shape policy – avant-garde work in government, if you ask me! I’m hoping that GDS pull their finger out and arrange a face-to-face interview next week, should I be successful, rather than waiting until after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued to learn how to work with team members from diverse backgrounds and with different emotional needs. Looking forward to hearing comments from people in our remote retro, so I can learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say without that retro, to be honest, we’ve been so immediately focussed on the work in front of us, there hasn’t been time to think about much else.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Spin Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The most fun I’ve had at work in a week on record. We’re doing work which sings to the vision of GOV.UK, making information about government and services simple, clearer and faster. Can’t knock it really, though it’s a heck of a change of pace from lying on the beach last week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the honour of spinning up a brand new sub-team. If you don’t count the outsourced teams I’ve run and looking after Platform Health while Martin’s off, this is my first time leading a multidisciplinary team at GDS – and I’m loving it. Staying aware of emotional energy while also having open conversations about delivering value for users is hugely enjoyable, especially when you have a team of excellent people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a quick kick-off on Tuesday from our lead technical architect, Tim, who explained that our team would be looking after dynamic content performance, the fourth of Platform Health’s OKRs that I set with Martin at the start of the quarter. After taking them through the technical introduction to GOV.UK’s architecture, I disbanded the group and set up to meet the following day at 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grouped at 10 a.m. on Wednesday and spent pretty much the entire day defining our mission: the objective, what success would look like, our ways of working, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window&quot;&gt;Johari Window&lt;/a&gt; to start building a roadmap. By 4 p.m. we had a team charter, a roadmap, a prioritised backlog and a set of cards to tackle the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aditya, one of our developers on the new sub-team, is profoundly deaf and working with him has been a real eye-opener. It hasn’t been that hard to bear his needs in mind, and I’m making sure to address him directly and speak clearly, but it does change the pace of conversation some times. It makes us more metered and considered, if anything, as more effort needs to go into how one conducts oneself. We’re also filling in a doc before and after daily ceremonies too, so that he can read through the morning’s stand-up or the afternoon’s playback if he’s working from home. That’s one element I really like, having a record of what I said to check against what I manage to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aditya is very pleasant to work with too, a gracious person who’s always smiling. We’ve a very considerate working culture at GDS but anyone would be hard pushed to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change their working patterns for him! Top bloke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tijmenbr&quot;&gt;Tijmen&lt;/a&gt;, our tech lead, had dived headlong into the new work with Jon, another developer on the team whom we’ve borrowed from the Observe team. Following a quick run-through of dynamic content applications on GOV.UK, they got started on looking into previous load-testing we’d done on Platform Health. They were able to quickly identify opportunities for optimisations, adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/pull/722&quot;&gt;HTTP caching&lt;/a&gt; and content caching where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tests on that pull request show an improvement on one Finder being able to serve 16x more requests with zero errors. The change was deployed later on that day and Tijmen put together a Grafana dashboard, to show the effect across all Finders and search pages on average, which I’ve been watching throughout most of Friday. It has reduced the number of requests being served by finder-frontend by 17%, widening the bottleneck and shifting the load onto our internal caches and the content delivery network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All within two days. Working at this rate, in a fast cycle, and achieving these results is testament to our working practice. It’s moments like this when you realise just what we can achieve in a short space of time with determination, skill and good frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got an interview at HMRC on Friday – woo! No news of the GDS PM interviews yet, but we’ll see what becomes of those. They’ve been delayed for quite a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I’m capable of leading a team…for a few days, anyway. Here’s hoping the next two weeks go just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been better if I’d foreseen needing to spend the entirety of Wednesday with the new sub-team, rather than thinking I could juggle that and Platform Health too. That was naïve of me, but there weren’t any ill effects on the team so perhaps it’s not such a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read through a boat-load of stuff on holiday, here’s a selection of the best bits. There’s a very particular theme, perhaps based on the fact I was reading Douglas Rushkoff’s &lt;em&gt;Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus&lt;/em&gt; at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This is how I work…give or take</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; wanted to see how I work, so here’s what I do, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Jukesie’s&lt;/a&gt; rip-off of the Lifehacker ‘How I Work’ series. Other public service folk have written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jukesie/this-is-how-we-work-give-or-take-6c8964cac85f&quot;&gt;how they work&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: London, UK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current gig&lt;/strong&gt;: Associate product manager, Government Digital Service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current mobile device&lt;/strong&gt;: Samsung J5 for work, iPhone 8 for percy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current computer&lt;/strong&gt;: MacBook Air 13” for work. Mac Mini at home. Some hobby Raspberry Pis and a PC too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;One word that best describes how you work&lt;/strong&gt;: Metered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-of-all-tell-us-a-little-about-your-background-and-how-you-got-to-where-you-are-today&quot;&gt;First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liked books and computers growing up. Spent a huge portion of my teenage years in my bedroom, tinkering on the Web or with computers. But I also enjoyed writing stories. Aged 16, I decided to focus on my Literature studies instead of Information Technology. It seemed to have…more prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did my A-levels, went to Bath Spa Uni to study Creative Writing. Bought a Mac to stop me playing video games. It worked, and I had a lot of fun. The course was excellent with great teachers – check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/schools/liberal-arts/interest-areas/creative-writing/creative-writing-publications/&quot;&gt;some of the authors who’ve also studied at Bath Spa&lt;/a&gt; – and I had my sights set on a career in publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduated. Spent the next year continuing cheffing, then quit to get some work experience and make the most of my degree. Spent two weeks as a managing editorial assistant at Vintage Publishing (part of Random House) and was asked back for another week. A few months later, there’s an open position as an editorial assistant and they ask me to apply. Incredibly, I get it and dive into the literary publishing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do that for 9 months. Move on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/company/publishers/vintage/jonathan-cape.html&quot;&gt;Jonathan Cape&lt;/a&gt;, attend a Booker Prize ceremony in my first week. It’s quite glitzy, maybe too glitzy, especially for a working class boy from Wolverhampton. I get the chance to work with some of the most eminent, prolific literary authors in the world. They even let me commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/109/1093783/finally-my-ambulance/9780099575870.html&quot;&gt;a book of short stories&lt;/a&gt;. But I feel massively out of my depth and haven’t been to Oxbridge, like most others at my level. Self-doubt sets in. Work is naught but toil. I grow tired of the sausage factory. I quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I have a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds pass after 6 months and I get a job at NOW TV, which was just starting out. See Agile and software development in action. Turns out that’s quite glitzy too, except I didn’t know that at school. IT is kind of cool now. &lt;em&gt;Hmm, maybe I could do tech after all.&lt;/em&gt; After some time in Operations, they initiate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/transfers-takeovers&quot;&gt;TUPE process&lt;/a&gt; for an entire department and I need to find other work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://porism.com&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt; has an opening for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I focus on increasing engagement and use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lginformplus.local.gov.uk&quot;&gt;LG Inform Plus&lt;/a&gt;, then get the chance to redesign and launch a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecasework.com&quot;&gt;eCasework&lt;/a&gt;. We spent a year on that before it went live. Take-up wasn’t good. I wrestled with marketing techniques, sales, developing some features and trying to talk to the few users we had. Wasn’t really sure what I was doing. It was…enjoyable, but also like banging my head against a brick wall. Repeatedly. Every day. Because I’m leading myself blind. (However, I also learn some cool stuff about open data, local government and generally learn tons from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining my anguish to a friend, he suggests that I’m kind of doing product management. I read a few blogs, try out the techniques, and they work. &lt;em&gt;Hmm, maybe I could do tech after all.&lt;/em&gt; Attending the product management course at General Assembly gives me new skills. We start to grow eCasework and its user base. We develop features that people love. But I’m a bit hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply for a job working on GOV.UK. They offer it to me. I’m overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I’m just really, really happy. I’m at home. I’m back in my bedroom, tinkering on the Web and with computers, on a piece of the national infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-us-through-a-recent-workday&quot;&gt;Take us through a recent workday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a T-shaped structure to my week which I try to stick to. Mornings are for product thinking, writing cards or catching up on important emails, except on Wednesdays when I’ll meet &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; for coffee. Then it’s a catch-up with Delivery Manager and Tech Lead, followed by stand-up with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the rest of the day is either meetings, team ceremonies or community meet-ups with other product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays are a bit lighter: product thinking, analysing data and trends, and chats with other specialists, often dappled with the odd meeting here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of what actually happens can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/@stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;my weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-apps-gadgets-or-tools-cant-you-live-without&quot;&gt;What apps, gadgets or tools can’t you live without?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; Reminders, my philosopher’s stone at work. With simple commands, I can remind myself or a colleague to do something. Need I say more? Since I have the app on my iPhone too, I can capture those work-related thoughts that spring up in the shower, at dinner or when I’m on holiday. It gets things out of my head, and only brings them back when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; a fair amount to save blogs to read. Medium’s Reading List also comes in handy, but I’m trying to move away from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, too. It’s the app I use most. To both fill time productively and waste it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mysocialsummary.com&quot;&gt;My Social Summary&lt;/a&gt; is great for catching up on Twitter without needing to scroll through Twitter. It looks for the most engaging tweets from lists you’ve built and sends you a daily digest. Definitely worth £3 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really taken to Post-it notes as a to-do list. I tried Trello but you’re not always able to add cards in meetings or ceremonies. Post-its are always at hand in GDS, so I can quickly capture sudden thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s some &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/my-bootstrapped-stack-dca24da282cd&quot;&gt;stuff I’ve used at work&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-best-shortcut-or-life-hack&quot;&gt;What’s your best shortcut or life hack?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to do something three times, automate it. If you can’t automate it, find a way to reduce the toil. You’ll immediately create more time to spend on things that really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-us-through-an-interesting-unusual-or-finicky-process-you-have-in-place-at-work&quot;&gt;Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you forget your work pass, you can’t get through many of the (mostly glass) doors. You end up staring forlornly at the people on the other side, who don’t know whether to let you in &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; ID. Sometimes several people walk past before you’re permitted to exit your dimension of uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked out how to capitalise on this yet. It’s &lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt; like a cigarette break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-keep-track-of-what-you-have-to-do&quot;&gt;How do you keep track of what you have to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, Slack Reminders and Post-it notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-favourite-side-project&quot;&gt;What’s your favourite side project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to refresh my &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and move blog posts away from Medium. But I’m also running out of kimchi so will have to make some more of that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-you-currently-reading-or-what-do-you-recommend-to-read&quot;&gt;What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend to read?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reading &lt;em&gt;Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus&lt;/em&gt; by Douglas Rushkoff for non-fiction, and &lt;em&gt;Memoirs of Hadrian&lt;/em&gt; by Marguerite Yourcenar for fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-else-would-you-like-to-see-answer-these-questions&quot;&gt;Who else would you like to see answer these questions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ellayanor&quot;&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pr0bablyfine&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncutlefish&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilylabram&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/femkesvs&quot;&gt;Femke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-best-advice-youve-ever-received&quot;&gt;What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You can do whatever you want in life, as long as you don’t hurt anyone.’ Oh, and: ‘Work is just a way to pay the bills, but it helps if you enjoy it.’ Both from my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Wind Down</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A four-day week spent closing open loops. Took yesterday off to pack for my holiday which I’m really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; looking forward to – especially because it’s supposed to drop to 1°C next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;John Cutler&lt;/a&gt; spared us an hour to chat product, and it was really beneficial. We talked quite a bit about valuing non-feature work, how it’s important and continuous improvement needs to happen under the hood too. That sort of work is our main focus on Platform Health, really, and selling it to ‘the business’ isn’t too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how this work is described by senior teams can irk me. Platform work is often referred to as ‘keeping the lights on’, but it’s really much more than that: it’s chopping wood, filling buckets, building aqueducts…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John mentioned Cost of Delay and it’s a useful prism to view all platform work through. &lt;em&gt;Does the value opened up by doing this story diminish over time?&lt;/em&gt; That sort of thinking allows you to take on anything urgent and create value in the short term while also keeping an eye on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had check-in with the programme team on Wednesday, or at least we were supposed to have check-in with them. The majority of them weren’t there, which was a let down as we had some important things to tell them. Really frustrating when you’ve had to work through lunch to get the presentation together too, because there’s so little time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays what with all the meetings. And putting the slides together on Monday would miss 20 per cent out of the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, our new Head of Product, Leanne, was there in force and tried her best to accommodate us. She was pleased with our progress and some of the optimisations we’ve brought to the publishing pipeline, wanting to push us to show it off. I’m really keen to get the team showing off what they’ve done because, as I always say, it’s not sexy work but it’s damn-near as important as building features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excellent &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; gave our team a run-down of SLIs, SLOs and SLAs – henceforth known as SLXs – and how they can create psychological safety in our work. We’ve had a go at creating one already (which I covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-delivery-93a08085cc32&quot;&gt;S02E03&lt;/a&gt;) and this was included in her slides, which meant to work was framed much better than I had introduced it to them. As Emily spoke about the noise of alerting and how to make alerts more meaningful, there was lots of nodding amongst the group. It certainly hit home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be looking at building SLOs for the other jobs of GOV.UK soon, once some important Brexity business is out of the way. In lieu of an actual stress-test of the pipeline, making our current data more meaningful will provide a decent, actionable contingency for the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darren Barnes from ONS came to talk about and demonstrate the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/the-gss-data-project/&quot;&gt;GSS Data&lt;/a&gt; project. Using linked data principles and technologies such as concept schemes, triple stores, URIs and all that other stuff, they’ve pulled together a neat open data portal that allows you to find statistics about stuff. It was super impressive, and it was nice to hear that they held &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;’s work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.esd.org.uk/about&quot;&gt;ESD and LG Inform&lt;/a&gt; in high regard – as an exemplar of what could be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That everything I learned about linked data at Porism could be useful during my time at GDS. That was quite a surprise. Darren was throwing out technical terms left, right and centre – and I understood everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compose myself during meetings. I get very excited about things and that’s not always good, especially if your body language communicates a commitment to a project prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Staying of the Course</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re reaching the mid-point of the quarter, so there’s a flurry of things going on. The team is chugging through work at a good pace, but there’s still so much to do if we’re to achieve the objective for our mission. Opening up conversation on how we’ll meet those goals has been good, but we’re subject to so many external factors it can sometimes be tough to stay the course. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/dealing-with-domineering-clients-67052f02f551&quot;&gt;Sailing analogies&lt;/a&gt; are quite good for framing team-work and missions, I find.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having migrated the first two applications over to a new hosting provider, we had a v-team retrospective with our friends in Reliability Engineering. It worked well, acting as a review of the steps we’d previously taken, giving us the chance to improve the run book for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one gotcha to eliminate for next time: making sure that the release pipeline is clear and no one’s forgotten to release Puppet changes specifically. Our lead architect, Tim, reminded everyone that it was their responsibility to own a pull request (and associated changes) all the way through and to keep the deployment pipeline as clear as possible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/continuous-delivery.html#use-continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;Continuous delivery&lt;/a&gt; relies on principles rather than process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had our first GOV.UK product manager fortnightly meet-up with the new Head of Product, Leanne. It was a bit full-on for her first session, but then again it was probably a perfect introduction for someone who’s going to own our high-level strategy for the forseeable future. We touched briefly on the product triage process – which has dominated most fortnightly meetings in recent months – and it was relatively trivial as opposed to the usual furore. That was good to see. Chatter about it had been dividing us as a community of late, but we were unified on it this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://leancoffee.org&quot;&gt;Lean Coffee&lt;/a&gt; approach to decide what we’d talk about next. Everyone wanted to talk overwhelmingly about the roadmap and the next 12 months – which, unfortunately, we’re not able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.productplan.com/p/bUmH4fHC0hOivX-E2LYMu2hg9uEhkWp_&quot;&gt;make public like in previous years&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not entirely certain on the reasons behind that but I don’t think it was an internal decision, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/developing-a-roadmap&quot;&gt;using roadmaps as an open communication tool is a principle we hold dear&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect it could be more to do with our roadmap being seen as a delivery plan rather than &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/vision-vs-strategy/&quot;&gt;a strategy to achieving a multipart vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, GOV.UK has pretty much (but not totally) achieved its &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html&quot;&gt;product–market fit&lt;/a&gt; and should now be concerned with scaling. The issue we have is that new and existing departments on GOV.UK often bring solutionised features to us as problems, and many expect their requests to be built out. We have a good set of products and features to offer to government but I’m not sure where the sales process happens, and we need an amount of feedback from those interactions to influence our product iterations. In the meantime there’s plenty of work to be done on scaling the platform’s architecture and that’s something we can do with application- and machine-level data alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it meant I missed a team lunch for a new starter on Platform Health, we took one and half hours out of a busy day to map the problem space of publishing, and it was really beneficial. Myself, Humin, Sam and Mark, all product managers on publishing aspects of the platform, wrote up the high level problems we see with scaling GOV.UK and grouped those by theme. It’s intended to form a strategy for solving those problems, but in a time when reliability is perhaps more important than efficiency, I’m not sure how much of it we’ll be able to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, it was excellent to get together with PMs from across the programme and join up our thinking. I’ve been meaning to do that ever since joining Platform Health, bringing other product teams and their goals into our team’s thinking. Because, arguably, I am currently a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/productschool/what-is-technical-product-management-anyway-d36deb3216d0&quot;&gt;technical product manager&lt;/a&gt; whether I intended to become one or not. And technical product management has internal teams as its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve got a couple of product ideas bobbing around and have a hankering to scratch the ‘build a thing’ itch, so if you want to get involved in a side hustle, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:stevenjmesser@gmail.com&quot;&gt;hit me up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent two hours coming up with options to upgrade and manage our Elasticsearch with Bevan. If I’m honest, I wasn’t really sure how to approach this, but I knew we needed a range of options plus their technical, financial and product-focussed impacts to present to the programme team for them to choose from. Sort of like a Choose Your Own Adventure business case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5772/1*49VaAAfIY-cEY5d6THUG8Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;A matrix of options plotted against risks, benefits, technical complexity, delivery time and financial costs&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A matrix of options plotted against risks, benefits, technical complexity, delivery time and financial costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freestyled a matrix of Post-it notes, detailing the different stages and options plotted against the risks, benefits, technical complexity, delivery time and financial costs of each. It actually worked quite well and we got all the brainstorming done inside of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a point was raised, there would usually be a counterpoint to consider for a different option, meaning we grew a body of thoughts quite quickly. Much better than scrolling up and down a document, scribbling in part-thoughts and half-formed sentences, which I’ve done previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bevan covered how we code and quality assure products and features at GOV.UK. This was off the back of our retrospective, where Alan had asked to be introduced to our process and I was keen to hear about it too. We’d been told about it informally but found this proper session really useful. And it was good to understand the inner workings as compared to the development process at previous places I’ve worked. It’s pretty fast at GOV.UK and everything’s to such a high quality, I was just really intrigued to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hangs off a set of principles rather than defined processes. I’m paraphrasing here, but essentially our developers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;are responsible for their code and features throughout the development and release lifecycle,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;should test their code and its dependencies,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;have code peer-reviewed for quality,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;should QA their code in integration, either individually or with product managers, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;use continuous delivery to release small, frequent changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital&quot;&gt;GDS Way&lt;/a&gt; but bear in mind that this works for us and may not suit other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all these facilitation techniques and Post-it noting practices are just methods for getting ideas out. Yes, I was skeptical at first and I know many people still are, but they work. If you’re struggling to have productive conversations at work and meetings go round in circles, try something different. There’s shitloads of blogs and other websites with loads of approaches you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask people to give feedback to my line manager. A colleague came over and praised me for some work, saying they’d pass it on, but I’ve neglected to ask people to do that in the past. I’m going to make sure I know who line manages each person on our team, too, so I can furnish them with all the good work our people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/f8e9c2ea-b29b-11e8-87e0-d84e0d934341&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governments fail to capitalise on swaths of open data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Comfort of Company</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;People were &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt; this week. Chats about life and around work, conversations on what we’re doing, and generally making and seeing friends. That doesn’t mean I’ve had much time spare, it’s been a busy week, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/9dad630c25b4&quot;&gt;Philippa&lt;/a&gt;’s post on resilience (check the Reading section) has framed it all rather well. It’s not about burning the candle at both ends, it’s about realising that rest takes different forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was unremarkable if not for proving that marking out time in your calendar for recurrent tasks is worthwhile. There were lots of meetings, a few with our performance analysts and data scientists which was cool, but the main success of the day was getting the next sprint planned. I’ve protected my Monday mornings for sprint planning and it paid off for the rest of the week. So that’s a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was absolutely back-to-back with team stuff, as it always is. Everyone seemed to vibe with the cards I’d brought into sprint, which was good, but I was rushing from meeting to meeting – and it was pretty draining. Meeting people &lt;em&gt;for fun&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t draining though, and I was grateful of my regular catch-up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/e2a8548b9f4f&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; and a lunch jaunt to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sub-cult.co.uk&quot;&gt;Sub Cult&lt;/a&gt; with Elliot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex is incredibly intelligent, articulate and friendly, and I sincerely hope he gets as much out of our chats as I do from him! When speaking, I tend to waffle and flit from thought to thought, a wholly different approach to my writing which can be pared down to something…comprehensible. Nevertheless, it’s great to talk to someone outside the building about teams, leadership, platforms and the odd joke here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our check-in with the programme team was all right, I was a bit pooped from a busy day, which meant that I didn’t understand a question from our lead technical architect, Tim. This gave me a good opportunity to ask for a chat with him, which I’d thought about in the bath that morning, as we kind of need some direction from him – or his involvement in our mission, would be better – in our infrastructure work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was another good year for JAM Conference. I first went last year and found it really inspirational, and the events this time around didn’t disappoint. It’s always good to have an excuse to spend time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/c8c40c52174f&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star of the show was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevekatospyrou/&quot;&gt;Steve Kato-Spyrou&lt;/a&gt;, who not only put forward good reasoning for striving for collaboration instead of conflict with stakeholders but was also fucking hilarious. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/e642edf7243c&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/2e12cea2061b&quot;&gt;Lindsey&lt;/a&gt; from Monzo gave a good talk about the people and practice behind good products, and answered my question about the principles they hold dear which make them better product managers. Unsurprisingly for a Government Digital Service (GDS) alumnus, Lindsey spoke often about good principles driving one’s practice, and I largely believe that little mantras can sometimes carry you further forward than action alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/b59d9418c84b&quot;&gt;Femke&lt;/a&gt; talk, as someone I’ve followed on Twitter for a while, and she’s really humble – it was a great talk on working in international markets as a Western company. But then again, that would require humility, so it’s nice to someone at Uber thinking that way – they’re not all as bad as Travis Kalanick. Femke’s talk book-ended a talk from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/ed6d3ecb45fb&quot;&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; at Wikimedia, talking about how they used Jobs-to-be-Done to draw parallels between users in both high-use and emerging markets. Basically: what is the common need between users in the USA and India? (Turns out it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/25/synced-reading-lists/&quot;&gt;synced reading lists&lt;/a&gt;.) I really liked this talk because it was about making a widespread information platform work for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#this-is-for-everyone&quot;&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt;: a problem that pervades my thinking every day. People asked questions about ensuring authenticity and credibility in a distributed system too, which is at the forefront of my mind after MozFest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that there was so much chat about stuff we’ve already done at GDS though, I think we need to be out there talking at these events as an organisation. GDS used to be on the frontline of product thinking and we’re just not that prevalent any more, and that’s sad. I’m going to ask around and see who fancies chatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday kicked off with a new way to think about our goals as a team. Our delivery manager has put forward a new idea, that we could meet each Monday midway through a sprint and quickly run through our goals for this sprint, next sprint and how those tie into our goals for the quarter. Another essential component will be talking about team health too, and whether we’ve had any major blockers recently. It’s not designed to replace retrospectives, stand-up or sprint planning, but it is an opportunity for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; on the team to step back, take a higher level view at what we’re doing, and make recommendations for where to go next. I’m really excited about this as more collaboration is definitely my product management style – I’m facilitator, not decision-maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/4cd140afefc2&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; popped in for a coffee and it was truly excellent to catch up. I loved meeting him at the Delib/Weeknotes event, his cerebral conversation is quite engaging. We spoke about the nature of services, who could provide them, distributed design and the Web model, and the challenges of working in the public sector. Lots of laughs too. Looking forward to seeing him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other main achievement of the day was a lunch chat with our lead technical architect, too. Because our work touches up against the long-run strategy for GOV.UK, it felt sensible to get him in on our ideas. All the problems we’re coming up against can be optimised in the short-term, but that won’t last and will need some planning to solve one day. There’s no time for us to fix those though. So we can dial down the long-run improvement work and dial up the discovery: of where problems lie, why they exist, the data points we use to measure those, and spending a little more thinking power on viewing this pipeline holistically. We’ve done some of that already, but the stress-testing work will help keep this moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ilearned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning is better than knowing. But you needn’t enact that learning immediately. Strategy is an important part of platform development, whereas you can forge ahead when building new products – because new products are more about disruption rather than development. So don’t be afraid to move more slowly on established products, because there’s many more factors to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-dobetter&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting in at 8 a.m. and leaving around 6 p.m. most days, so could be better at sticking to my hours. The extra hour and a half isn’t draining though, and I do have a lot on: looking after 46 interconnected applications plus moving them all to a new hosting provider, the support queue for a busy licensing product, our product management community and a big team. You do need a few more minutes to keep on top of all that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Delivery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather a happy week, on the whole, and much calmer than last week. There’s less busyness now that the unconference is out of the way, fewer things flying around my head. More thinking space to focus on day-to-day matters. Got this out the door early as I’m heading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozillafestival.org&quot;&gt;MozFest&lt;/a&gt; now, so tweet or telegram me if you’re heading there too. I’m planning on checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1055787778267664384&quot;&gt;these things&lt;/a&gt; on data, publishing, Semantic Web and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four new associate product managers joined GDS recently. One has been with the organisation for a few years, but the other three are Fast Streamers. One of those Fast Streamers, Adam, actually joined as a developer – but they’ve placed him in a product role. As we’re trying to kick the buddying scheme back into life in the product management community, I spent an hour with him on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethics in human resources aside, he’s doing pretty well despite not having a background in the practice. He has started poring through &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/bb88a6d5fb68&quot;&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BOzRg_e-qE24bYHSSKNFq5rUYca4U0rVeb5aG710kRo&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; and has caught a couple of blog posts online, to gain a footing, and it’s helping him in being able to answer questions and make decisions on his team. I wanted to make sure he had a good understanding of what product was and why it works, though, so went over the ‘Business, Tech, UX’ Venn diagram, the product lifecycle, how to use a lean canvas and &lt;em&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/em&gt; approach to product development. He seemed much more chilled out at the end of our chat, and I offered him help whenever he needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; nail it, being a developer with a product manager head would be a huge advantage. There are many founders and CEOs out there with those skills, so this could be great for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team swarmed on how scheduled publications work under the hood, and we set a service level objective (SLO) for that job. I’ll explain how we did that, but full credit goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/f30ef58c4490&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; for putting this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mapped the user journey for scheduling a page for publication, using a press release as an example. We drew out the steps horizontally, then noted beneath each step the applications and stack that powered that part of the journey. Next we listed the data points, or service level indicators (SLIs), between each step which verify the user can complete the job successfully. For example, the publishing application returns a 200, the publishing API has workers free to take the job, the content item is built and has an ID, etc. These SLIs in sequence form a pattern we can observe to know that users can successfuly schedule publications. We could monitor it constantly or only refer to it during an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we needed to set an SLO: a measure of the performance of the service with a target for its performance. Each content item has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publishing_delay&lt;/code&gt; property which shows the time difference between when the user intended it to be published and when it was actually published. Over the last 3 months it has been 1–18 seconds on average during good spells, but if an incident occurs it has been known to max out at 3 days. Quite the delay! We decided that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publishing_delay&lt;/code&gt; for each content item should be 1–59 seconds, meaning that our SLO is for pages to be published within the minute of schedulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin’s on holiday for two weeks, which means I’m the only PM on the team. It feels good to have temporary sole leadership of our team objectives, and it’s good experience to manage a team of our size. Though I have been leading on the pipeline work for some time, I don’t feel like I’m in Martin’s shadow this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our sprint planning which seemed to go well. People were enthused about working on pipeline stuff and didn’t have any questions about the sprint goals I’d set. So I think I’ve settled in! I know our domain, I’m hyped to work on a really technical team, and we’re doing cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our retro was pretty chilled too. The only significant problem we discussed was that using GPG for encryption was cumbersome and maybe we could change it! We’re working as a solid unit on Platform Health now, I’m really grateful to have my first go at running a large agile team with these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did some planning of the quarter ahead and how we’ll meet our key results. This was mostly sticking up Post-its on our physical board for the initiatives we’ll need to complete, which meant we needed to iterate the workstreams we’d laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-launch-of-quarter-3-cf4e1b6ac614&quot;&gt;S02E01&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we’d initially chosen to list our key results as workstreams, it feels better to list the different classes of activity we’ll undertake to learn and make improvements. The three key workstreams are now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideas and Research, to find out what we know, don’t know and need to know&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build and Test, to create or improve a thing and make sure it doesn’t break anything else&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure and Learn, to set or test a benchmark and analyse whether our hypothesis has been validated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the framework for a lean experimental approach mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-finale-bda5ca81237c&quot;&gt;S01E10&lt;/a&gt; and should help ensure we keep focussed on making proactive improvements to the pipeline, meaning we don’t get sidetracked by BAU reactive work and fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, we gave Tom a good send-off at the pub. Spent lots of time talking with Rob, our lead product manager until he heads of to productise an interesting new start-up. Half about work stuff and my ideas for the platform, but the other half just about personal life. Turns out we both have a fisherman for a father! Lots of time spent as a kid by a riverbank wondering when the fun would start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t yet hear back from the recruitment team about the product manager vacancies at GDS, which is annoying as interviews are supposed to start on Monday. Perhaps they’ve had to knock it back – or maybe loads of superstars have applied! I’m fairly confident that I’ll get an interview based on what others have been telling me, but it’s natural to worry. Perhaps I’ll apply for the vacancy at HMRC which Alex mentioned or maybe the one at MOJ Scott has. I would really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like to stay at GDS though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ilearned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiatives don’t have to fit neatly into key results, or you will have to do some work which spans across a couple of key results. Workstreams are themes of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-dobetter&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stormed into the SLO-setting session without much of a plan except what was in my head. I’ll need to firm that up for the next time we run a session, so that there’s less _umm_ing and _ahh_ing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Unconference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These notes are hurriedly typed up, not well formatted, and probably impenetrable – but they make sense to me. I’ve pulled out the main lessons from the week, but everything was overshadowed by the unconference – which was a real success. I’m very proud of that and in debt to the people who helped me put it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of energy though, so this week’s notes haven’t been given the same dedication as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had aimed to work out which applications needed work in the pipeline by looking at stats in AWS X-Ray, our request tracing software. Spent most of the morning trying to get access to it. We’ve only recently got access to Amazon Web Services set up, so we have only a few administrators, and everyone who could help was at AWS Game Day. It was frustrating that I couldn’t start gathering data that would be essential for backing up any work we decide to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that changed in the afternoon. I heard about an incident review and realised we had to cater to &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; going through the pipeline, not just fix the slow stuff. It got me thinking: maybe looking at the data first wasn’t the right way to go, and everything should be based on user value. I changed tack and thought about criticality of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; jobs-to-be-done on GOV.UK. It’s a way to cut through everything the platform offers and prioritise everything against each other. I was in a serious flow of creative thinking but needed to check my analysis against something, so I went and bothered &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/f30ef58c4490&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;. She helped by sharing how they’re approaching setting SLIs by mapping user journeys and stack traces against outcomes. This was massively helpful – exactly what I needed – and I went away to start building a framework to help us work out which applications need work &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boon here is that we have tons of data, swathes of it – huge tracts of data – but now we know how to slice it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the framework together in the morning and started weighting some jobs against each other. Realised we needed to validate our assumptions against some qualitative data, started thinking about how to form a survey for the programme, content product leads and other teams – the intro of which became an explainer for the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had pre-planning, explained my ideas to Martin and Bevan. The framework supports the research Bevan’s already done and the hypotheses he’s put together for improving things, and it gives us an objective view of what we’re fixing and by how much. We should be able to marry up, quite quickly, their ideas to a delivery plan without much ambiguity. Arguably the technologists on our team would be able to fix the pipeline without a product manager, they’re hugely talented, but the framework gives us a way to get buy-in from the management team – and check our assumptions too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later there was an interesting comment when a team member said that some parts of the onboarding process were crap, but when asked how they’d change it they just reiterated it was crap. They didn’t offer ideas for what they’d hoped would be different. Bevan said that people don’t immediately realise they have the agency to change things, but we do at GDS. We can actually improve our workplace, and it’s a good point. Mustn’t forget that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great morning coffee with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/e2a8548b9f4f&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;. We talked about selling ideas into teams and how, ideally, platform teams should be able to work autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have spent much of the last two weeks helping a Content Designer from another department with their struggles dealing the culture of their workplace. It’s deadline heavy, their scrum masters don’t listen and just are not really willing to help. Bad situation but felt it was important to help them try and improve the scenario, but also reminded them that they can choose which battles to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a tougher-than-usual sprint planning session but that was to be expected. Last week’s didn’t register with people and I’ve since had new thinking to help frame things, and wanted to make sure that landed well. So, I put forward cards for how we’ll change tack and look at defining how different bits of the stack fit together based on Jobs-to-be-Done. Had some healthy challenge from Bevan, and one of our developers, Tom, asked &lt;em&gt;What if it turns out the problems are all with Whitehall Publisher?&lt;/em&gt; Well, at least then we’ll have the data to spin up a mission around fixing or replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to find a way to turn all the latent problems with GOV.UK into a 12-month roadmap. Feel like this could be the beginning of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was spent celebrating GOV.UK’s sixth birthday, and it still feels like an honour to work on this thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was supposed to present at the Delivery &amp;amp; Support fortnightly huddle but a couple of folk overran, so we got bumped to the next one. Not terrible but I’d rather not spend another 45 minutes on a Thursday morning stood with cortisol and adrenaline sumping through my system. We’re going to be billed first at either the next all-staff or next D&amp;amp;S fortnightly, so at least something came good of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote some prompt cards about working in the open, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/fb24db1416c3&quot;&gt;@jukesie&lt;/a&gt; for the inspiration. We checked in with the programme team which was all good. They’re happy with our progress and asked us to share our approach to check-ins with the rest of the programme, so I’ll build on those OKR slides and share here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took a Pedal Me bike taxi home, tested the PA system for livestreaming at the unconference, but found out that one key bit was missing. Poo. At least it was one less thing to worry about but I had really wanted to share Marty Cagan’s talk for people who were unable to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatted to Bevan about an incident from Thursday. Fixing it nicely coincides with work we’re due to do next, so encouraged him to write up cards and pull the work through. Felt good to have some of the framework validated in real-life, based on real events. Had stand-up then went off to Geovation to get the unconference going. I’ve been working on this for a couple of months, so there were some butterflies in the morning, but they dissipated by the time I arrived – just really wanted it to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was a little late but Jon, Marie, Anna-Marie and Alex had got going. We had a run-through of the day, and there was little left to sort out, but James was really helpful in shaping how to run the session voting. And we were really lucky that Geovation had some tech to get the livestream sorted! They had a Mevo which could stream direct to Vimeo – a massive relief!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People started arriving, we had pizza, everyone was hanging out, then we got started. The sessions were pitched well and lively. Really glad people engaged with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marty turned up and was pretty chill. Nice bloke, and really nice of him to take time out to chat to us. It was an inspiring talk, as you might expect, and I was overjoyed that there was so much note-taking in the crowd. Let me know if you want to watch it, I’ll ping the link over. (Check cross-gov Slack in the #prodmgmt channel if you’re on there.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ended the day at the pub, a couple of glasses of wine, and a healthy chat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/f30ef58c4490&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; on the Overground home. It was an incredible day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ilearned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I know what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not found myself suffering from imposter syndrome, and though it’s important not to be egotistical as a product manager, this week really felt like I was hitting my stride. Maintaining that flow while also keeping a healthy dose of humility about my work is now my focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-dobetter&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be ready to take on challenge from other team members, and not be phased by it. It’s my job to guide us, not set the work, so I might sometimes have to be Devil’s Advocate to my own plans in order to explore the team’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Launch of Quarter 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A new quarter, a new series. My weeknotes have been an excellent learning aid so far, so I’m carrying on with them. It was awesome to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/4cd140afefc2&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/fb24db1416c3&quot;&gt;@jukesie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/53cebec8f152&quot;&gt;Coco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/fdfe39be24e0&quot;&gt;Louise&lt;/a&gt; last week and it wouldn’t have happened without this little journaling style. I’m putting together an unconference session around working in the open as a result, please send me your tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair chunk of this week was dedicated to getting the team set up, so I’ve written about that. It’ll be helpful in the future. I probably drank too much though, and after a fun Friday drinking with two workmates I was &lt;em&gt;wiped&lt;/em&gt; yesterday – hence why these are later than usual. I’ll also be moving everything to my own website soon, though still posting on Medium for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;weeknotes aggregator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke a bottle of champagne over the bow of quarter 3 and launched the damn thing. Monday was all about kicking things off: grouping the team together, going over what’s changed and what’ll stay the same, introducing our priorities for the next 3 months, and welcoming our two new members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*GyDxP0ou65R1XNBMRlRTlQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been reading my weeknotes for a while, you’ll remember that I covered our objectives and key results for 2018/19 Q3 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-finale-bda5ca81237c&quot;&gt;S01E10&lt;/a&gt;, but since some people might find it useful, here’s the slide we use to visualise and report on our OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also put together a slide deck which explained our team and its work in a little more detail for our new developers, Alan and Aga. We spent an hour with them in the afternoon, taking them through the point of our team, our vision, what we’d done before and how that fits in to our the work we’re doing soon. Context is everything to ensure we hit the ground running, and I wanted to make sure they had everything explained plus a document they could refer back to. It also gave them an opportunity to ask questions, and they seemed quite happy with everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last job for the day was to mark up our physical boards with grid tape. It’s something I asked for us to introduce last quarter, so we can orient ourselves, and it was hugely helpful. You can mark the sprint goals for each workstream throughout the quarter, getting a sense for whether you’re likely to achieve your overall goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9_j6DbdUTEEbJwRyatCN5g@2x.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Q2 physical board. A grid with sprints as columns and workstreams as rows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our wonderful delivery manager introduced the Platform Health delivery style. They went over agile vs waterfall, the difference between scrum and kanban, and explained our hybrid method and why it works. There was also a game about what happens when the product manager changes the priorities of a sprint halfway through, and how to account for that. Largely we try not upend things once we’ve started a sprint but as a (sort of) support team, other people can have other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/86da9a49c10b&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; and me ran another product management community session. Our new Head of Community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JPForman86&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;, said hello to the everyone; our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-russell-6760564/&quot;&gt;Deputy Director for Product&lt;/a&gt; told everyone about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.jobvite.com/gds/jobs/category?c=Product+management#jobs&quot;&gt;new product roles&lt;/a&gt; we could apply for; Katie and Alex showed us about behaviour-driven development; and we had an AMA with outgoing lead product manager on Reliability Engineering, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomdolanuk/&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom’s an exceptional product manager, the kind of vision leader who can cogently inspire, explain and motivate in a small sum of words. The audience could ask him questions using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sli.do&quot;&gt;Slido&lt;/a&gt; on their phones, and we had these displayed on a big screen. My initial hope was that people might ask some cheeky questions but everyone was quite well mannered, and the questions mostly sought to learn from his good experience. We’re going to try it again at a future event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met recent weeknotes convert, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/e2a8548b9f4f&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, who works at &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/d076523eaf3b&quot;&gt;Unruly Media&lt;/a&gt; which is luckily in the same building. We had an excellent chat about team culture, working on infrastructure projects, the value of being open, and our shared experiences of civic tech. He put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://democracyclub.org.uk/projects/polling-stations/embed/&quot;&gt;Democracy Club’s polling station finder widget&lt;/a&gt; (I think I’ve got that right) which was super useful during the last big round of local elections. We’ve set up a weekly coffee to learn more from each other and meet with other tech people in Whitechapel – all thanks to weeknotes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a retro for quarter 2, the main takeaway from which was that everyone feels good about their work. I’ve been trying to encourage us to blog more but we feel limited by the system the Comms team has put around it. It’s important for us to feel empowered to talk about our work through official channels, and I offered to help work on blog posts with anyone who wanted to write one. But on Monday I’ll be sharing this weeknote and hope some people will jump onboard. One of our developers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk/tag/weeknotes.html&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, already has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/seal/blob/release_52/config/alphagov.yml#L110&quot;&gt;team charter&lt;/a&gt; was another 45 minutes well spent. It gave us the opportunity to review how well we’d applied our thinking, as well as space to talk about anything we might want to add. It turns out that the team charter is quite a lynch pin to how we work, and it was good that everyone wanted to spend time on it. Something I must bear in mind for future teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with Heads of Product across government about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cross-government-product-people-unconference-tickets-50708536598&quot;&gt;unconference&lt;/a&gt; I’ve accidentally organised for product managers. Jon’s joined at just the right time and been able to pick up some tasks, including helping me wrangle some other key players. He’s even gone and created a slide deck for the day, so we can show the agenda and messages to attendees. He’s been really helpful and it’s an excellent show of how he’ll run the show as head of community, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did lots of product thinking. My calendar’s looking quite empty on Fridays for the next few months, so I’m going to mark it out as a day for product thinking. Was able to pore through some data with our tech lead, Bevan, which we’d collected through X-Ray. He came up with some great ideas for how we can meet our key results using existing methods, which I think will help us get ahead. I’ll be working much more closely with Bevan this quarter, so I’m excited to see what he’ll come up with as the weeks move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sense-checked my thinking against Martin, who seemed to think it was all sound. We walked and talked, venturing down to the riverside at Tower Bridge, which was a lovely way to spend half an hour. Also, walking is a great enabler of thinking – the repetitive motion helps your body get into the flow state, I find. I wrapped it all up and published some thinking on our Q3 wiki page, and I’d like to make sure that’s updated across the quarter. It’s an essential record of what we’re doing and what we discover, which can help future versions of ourselves (as I learned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-step-up-2f6926ad0981&quot;&gt;S01E03&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-ilearned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good structure around your work and your team can democratise how it works. I was surprised by how much everyone was invested in the team charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-dobetter&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delegating work to the most appropriate agents. I am very much an ideas man – in general and in my role – but others are willing to make those ideas happen too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Finale</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of time spent in meetings or at events this week, but I did manage to hold one worthwhile team session, at least. Need to start blocking out time in my calendar for menial tasks next quarter — emails, Trello, backlog-sorting and the like — so that meetings don’t derail making progress. Desperately need to &lt;strong&gt;get shit done&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the final episode of my first series of weeknotes. I’ve decided to start a new series each quarter and since next week I’m not in the office, I’ll miss the final sprint and won’t have anything work-related to talk about. So I’m taking two weeks off and will be back with series two in the second week of October!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this…especially this week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly spent Monday thinking about the future, the very immediate future. Quarter 3 missions have been finalised, ours being to prepare the GOV.UK platform for the scale demands of Brexit. The point of the mission is to de-risk EU Exit (for GOV.UK) by preparing for large numbers of visitors and concurrent publishing. There’s lots of opportunity to use an lean experimental approach, setting hypotheses and testing scenarios, reading the results to inform product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our key results contributing to a successful mission will be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;migrating GOV.UK applications to AWS,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting publishing speed and reliability benchmarks and improving those by 10%,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stress-testing the pipeline with 2x, 4x, 6x and 8x peak activity, setting hypotheses for improving concurrent publishing next quarter, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;serving 2x previous hourly peak traffic with no drop in performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my head, it’s going to work a bit like the production and development of space capsules in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury&quot;&gt;Project Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, which I saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (This week’s image is NASA research mathematician Katherine Johnson, whose story and work the film covers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went for lunch to try and work out our development approach but ended up talking about people. We’re blessed with some excellent developers on our team, but one project has been unfortunately siloed and losing its lead would be a detriment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121211-00/?p=5863&quot;&gt;V-teams&lt;/a&gt; have their own cadence, despite how fast your own part moves. So we’ll need to tussle for that developer’s inclusion on our roster next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did explore options for making concurrent publishing better though, and it’ll be interesting to see those develop further as we put the pipeline through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to an all-staff event, to hear about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Carrie999Murray/status/1042119219545104384&quot;&gt;GDS’s future agenda and how it’s being made a great place to work&lt;/a&gt;. I do love working at GDS and feel blessed to work on GOV.UK, but frankly I’m oblivious as to how much of that can be credited to the current management. Could be loads, could be little, I’ve honestly no idea. Regardless, they’re doing their bit and I get paid each month, so I can’t complain. It’s essential, though, that we sustain the grassroots start-up culture and people have space to do their best work. We should ask for forgiveness rather than permission on the frontlines of transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the corporate jargon (sorry, corporate building blocks), we heard lightning talks from teams who’re really bringing in the results. Would have been better to fill the event with those stories, to be honest. And so closing on a tale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Matt_Leat/status/1042105873336860674&quot;&gt;how open standards can save lives&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoAgileGov&quot;&gt;James Findlay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Matt_Leat&quot;&gt;Matt Leat&lt;/a&gt; was awesome. It worked in the Victorian era when railways were breaking new ground, and it’s the same now. Ask them to share that talk if you’re exploring open standards at any time, it gives you good perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/c8c40c52174f&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;’s blog on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/porism/boring-boring-standards-8843b2ea1f85&quot;&gt;why standards are surprisingly not boring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.porism.com&quot;&gt;a guide to creating and maintaining open standards&lt;/a&gt; which is also from my alma mater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Held a scoring session on our backlog of cards grouped under a theme to promote the underlying health of GOV.UK. Those come from a mixture of sources: tech debt, other mission work, ideas from 2nd Line shifts, and good ol’ regular forward-thinking. They haven’t been a priority for the last three months, but given that we’re about to enter a period where the health of the platform is paramount, it seemed like a good idea to look through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a simple Value vs Effort matrix to score cards and help us make decisions on where to focus effort, checking the relative value of each card. It pays to be ruthless in time-keeping, avoiding too much talk – it’s not a science, we’re only looking for an objective view. I’ll write a post on how I structured that session, in case it’s of use to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best result was archiving cards we’d done already in other work. Some cards had their nature altered too; for example, a card about extending an interoperable method to our publishing API turned into one about removing that method from the stack entirely. We’d superseded it with a better, more long-term solution! But the rest is either low-hanging fruit, stuff that needs to be planned into sprints, and ‘anytime’ or ‘some time’ cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a remote meeting with Heads of Product across government to talk about an event we’re putting together. It’s good to get the perspective of how product management works across government, and it’s just nice to say hello to your colleagues in other departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ironed out the theme of the event, ideas on the running order, and other logistical bits and pieces. There’s a little more work to do this weekend but, once that’s done, we should be able to release tickets early next week. (It’s free but the size of the venue limits how many spaces we have to offer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin and I made some headway into our data science course, first mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-snorlax-95f4ac78c4c4&quot;&gt;S01E07&lt;/a&gt;. It was mostly getting to grips with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tableau.com&quot;&gt;Tableau&lt;/a&gt;, a data analysis and visualisation tool, which is really good. You simply feed it a CSV or open data API endpoint and it’ll work out the measures and dimensions, allowing you to build visualisations quickly. You can create calculated measures too, adding new levels of analysis on top of the raw dataset. If you’re at all curious about data science, what it is and how to do it, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/share/1000juBUMeeFZRTX4=/&quot;&gt;Data Science A-Z™&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy is the one we’re taking and would fill a weekend comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking about what projects we could start during the course. I’m intrigued to know if the way content is arranged on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.gov.uk&quot;&gt;blogs platform&lt;/a&gt; makes a difference to performance metrics. For example, does fewer paragraphs under headings affect scroll depth? Do blog posts with images receive more traffic, and, if so, do pictures of people or diagrams make a difference? But I know Martin’s keen to analyse what items food banks need – an idea I had back in December in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/porism/democratising-civic-problem-solving-1a3c81a6d3b7&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; – and that’s certainly a more worthy use of our time and brains. Be cool to automate it all and publish the data openly with &lt;a href=&quot;https://octopub.io&quot;&gt;Octopub&lt;/a&gt; or something, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The team is the unit of delivery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dust off those dormant backlogs, you might surprise yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jump right in and get involved in your community – it’s FUN!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning new concepts is achievable if you give yourself the time to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Successful Experiment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks have been really packed, so you might find this set of weeknotes quite brief. I’m giving myself a breather. The practice is valuable but isn’t without cost, so this is a little mid-series rest. Perhaps I’ll try one of the other formats or try inventing my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is there a list of formats, #weeknotes crew? Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/1914560770fb&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; put together a post on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknote-styles-61d957e58a4a&quot;&gt;styles used across the weeknotes community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blasted through the inbox. Had a meeting with a council finish early and a meeting with a colleague was also cancelled, giving me more time to work through stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caught up with a department on their progress, all moving along nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also spent an hour with Joe talking about OKRs, KPIs, etc. Mainly chatted about the framework that’s been rolled out across GDS, how it’s working for other programmes but doesn’t fit well with GOV.UK. Suspect we’ve always been a bit of a different beast but I’d like to introduce experimentation to our team’s approach next quarter, to make us think about measurability more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/10/how-were-improving-publishing-times/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published – yay! The first one I’ve written since joining GDS in January, which is great because their blogging was part of what inspired me to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the Q3 missions close to being finalised in the GOV.UK PM community meet-up. Everyone’s sold on our mission, to continue improving the publishing pipeline and stress test it for Brexit: high load, concurrent jobs and reliable tools. I thought about a simple open roadmap for GOV.UK, might have to get one going during firebreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also met with Mark, who’s with DExEU briefly, and our 2nd Line crew to cover the next big Brexit publishing event – the second round of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/technicalnotices&quot;&gt;technical notices&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve got a different tactic this time, based on the sequence of events last time, and we’ll be testing out our new cache invalidation service. Everyone was pretty calm and felt secure, the rounds of testing definitely helped. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/06/running-a-game-day-for-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;Game Day approach&lt;/a&gt; to getting through worrying times is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randomly got to meet the new head of product management community, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JPForman86&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt;. He caught wind on Slack that we were heading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank/events/253945616/&quot;&gt;ProductTank on internal products&lt;/a&gt; and we invited him along. Went for a curry at Tayyab’s first, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/f30ef58c4490&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; and Martin too, a great way to induct someone into the PM community! Also gave us an opportunity to learn about him informally, and to tell him about the culture at GDS, how we’re wary of anything too corporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I thought it was a pretty naff ProductTank, but I finally got to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/fb24db1416c3&quot;&gt;@jukesie&lt;/a&gt; which was awesome! Been following that guy on Twitter for years, glad to have the chance to say hello. Can’t wait for the #weeknotes meet-up in Bristol now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publishing of the technical notices went like a breeze. And our experiment with cache invalidation worked! 🎉 We were able to serve new and updated content quickly, with fewer of the imperfections of last time. This not only gives us confidence that our hypotheses for fixes are correct, we’ve also made considerable improvements this quarter. We’re writing a blog post on that work, will share it when it’s ready, but there’s a big headline metric for the end of quarter Show &amp;amp; Tell we can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs are there to help you be objective in a complicated world of ‘delivering value’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simulating failure in a safe environment is an incredible way to learn more about your systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community is central to the human experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We know what’s healthy, what’s not and how to fix things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-imreading&quot;&gt;What I’m Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Ellie taught me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ellayanor/status/1037756853579599881&quot;&gt;low spoons&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve looked at my own mental capacity in a different light. The past couple weeks have been a bit busy, so I’ve avoided stuffing my head with more information this week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cusp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re in a liminal zone, a headspace between two periods but only present physically in one. It’s a headtrip to operate that way. For most of the quarter we’ve been working from a physical board, but as we’re nearing the end of that and there’s no board for next quarter, you have to keep everything in your head. That saps energy, and it’s something to learn from for next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A busy week with lots of brain-thinking stuff and tiredness, but here’s what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over how our content designer, Mark, helped DExEU publish the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/technicalnotices&quot;&gt;technical notices&lt;/a&gt;, to understand the user behaviour behind publishing those documents. There’s more to come from government and we want to be prepared to help deliver that information. He placed trust in scheduling a publication which not all users do, so that’s one area to keep an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been assuming there’s some work to be done to build back publishers’ trust in the publishing system as a whole, but validating that could be tough. However, there’s other mission teams on GOV.UK looking after publisher workflows and they’ll likely be looking into satisfaction ratings. Having said that, it’s an opportunity to get in front of users on a team that rarely has face-to-face contact with our publishing community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first PM community session organised by ProductBuro went well – I think. Yay! Iain gave a good talk about metrics, reminding us that we can go back to basics and choose to observe the signals that tell us we’re solving problems. Afterwards we had a chat about long run indicators, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknotes-s01e02-81f7c23f5bb5&quot;&gt;something which I’ve touched on previously&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a Product for Good meet-up. For example, a good metric to measure the value of GOV.UK is a reduction in contact volume to call centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given there’s lots of chat about KPIs, measuring value and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2017/digital-government-inquiry-launch-17-19/&quot;&gt;general wondering about whether Government Digital Service is worth it&lt;/a&gt;, articulating the difference between short term performance measurement and long term impact assessment could be quite pertinent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting other product managers across the community is always interesting, especially when government causes our practice to be warped from the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lisa_e_scott&quot;&gt;Lisa&lt;/a&gt; organised an unprecedented Product People meet-up in London…or at least I’ve never been to one so busy, with so many speakers! We heard from product managers at HMRC, MoJ, GDS and CQC about product management on a non-software team. Developing policy is different to developing a product, but the tools you use and how you describe success, how people drive outcomes, is almost identical. It comes down to the tenets of product management: an understanding of users and a desire for fight for their needs, an understanding of the organisation and a willingness to involve their insights, and an understanding of the mechanics of your problem space. If you don’t mind being Chief Antagonist, you’ll be all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I got to meet the inimitable Rose Waite who co-founded the Product People meet-up (she’s written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/29/tips-on-how-to-set-up-and-maintain-your-own-community/&quot;&gt;how Product People got started and how to maintain a community&lt;/a&gt;), and she spoke of the revolution within government that is indicative of transformation. I’m wondering whether we’re entering a second generation of that movement, as the &lt;em&gt;avant-garde&lt;/em&gt; move on in great numbers, and how we sustain the momentum. There’s OneTeamGov, yes, but if your direct leadership team isn’t a part of it, what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do @ me, I know the weeknotes community will have valuable thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought about 45 per cent of myself to work one day. Partly a result of falling asleep on the sofa accidentally, rousing from slumber by the cat at 2 a.m., then plodding to bed. Waking again 2 hours later, lain upright with a crick in my neck from too many pillows was a further dint. Trying to push through any day on little sleep, let alone a busy one in the final third of a quarter, is really tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thankfully we’re gifted with flexible working at Government Digital Service. Tomorrow I can work from Wales (WFW) in any place with a table and WiFi. This kind of flexibility, which enables one to work hard but adjust their environs based on circumstance, operates beneath a layer of trust. And it’s not something to be taken for granted. I can have a full night’s rest, in a silent village, and still work on complex problems tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We engineer our working lives to make optimal achievements, but underneath it all we’re just humans with unquantified, organic machinery. Sometimes nature’s signals are the best alerts to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from all that, I was grateful to Joe – a senior business analyst looking at KPIs across our programmes – for reaching out and asking for more time to chat through something. We’d left a chance conversation the previous day unfinished and it needed a conclusion; he stepped up and heard me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I got a bit sad we hadn’t been able to achieve a load on the pipeline work. But I was reminded that we have lots on, and there’s still time left. Thankfully everyone’s enthused with the work and wants to do more, and I’m looking forward to forming a final productive push. I’m getting together with our technical lead and a senior dev on Monday to shape the stories, and we’ll put them in front of the team when there’s room on the quarterly roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research is good, but some times you won’t learn anything new&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We still need a way to look into turning qualitative comments into quantitative metrics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes nature’s signals are the best alerts to monitor – take time for you&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Snorlax</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember in Pokémon Red when a giant beast blocked the road ahead? It was sleeping soundly but looked like a terrifying adversary. Your prods and pokes did nothing to rouse it, but still it lay there, blocking the way. To get past it, you had to go on a convoluted journey to beat your sporting rivals, climb atop a tower and eventually be handed a special flute. Then you had the fight the beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was mostly planning a convoluted journey in a short space of time, and we’ve still got to fight the beast. As a result, this week’s notes are shorter and less reflective. It was a busy week and I’m still tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met our new head of data science. They’re giving a talk at the next product &amp;amp; service manager community meet-up, so we touched base to say hello and for me to offer help (with my ProductBuro hat on). Though the data science community is small, made up of ~6 people parachuted into teams as needed, it‘ll help product teams learn more about their world and the problem space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s important about this talk is it’ll give the community some context: how data scientists work, their tools and processes, the sorts of questions data science can answer. Data science can teach us a lot, but understanding the boundaries of what it can deliver, in what timeframe, is essential. No one wants to be asked to complete a PhD project in 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in relation to that, Martin and I JFDI’d starting a data science course! I’ve been thinking about doing something since early July and Martin wanted to get involved too, so we made a start on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e&quot;&gt;the best data science course as according to one data scientist&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a pretty general overview of the tools and techniques, and I’m excited to play with SQL again, and it’ll be a nice deep-dive into that world. If we end up making a project, I’ll blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop to help a department with a thorny Brexit thing happened. It went quite well and they’re happy to get moving. I found it very tiring though – four hours leading four people through a sort-of design sprint. Couldn’t have done it without Elliot’s tech involvement and Nick’s delivery management though. Haven’t really had much chance to step back and think about the consultancy model for ‘selling’ our products into other transformation programmes, but will make a note to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Brexit shaped thing swooped in, which actually dominated the week. It’s a massive milestone in our roadmap (in everyone’s lives too) and the lack of clarity on what people will need to do come March 2019 is troubling. However, there’s ways in which we prepare for that and make GOV.UK’s vision – the best place to find government services and information – central to how the country will navigate exiting the EU. We spent a good two days looking through a Brexit lens at our propositions for the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t change our strategy on Platform Health much, we’re still focused on scaling the platform to meet increased demand. We’ve been viewing everything through a Brexit lens anyway, deprioritising anything which wouldn’t contribute to meeting its demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with other professions is &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; – expand your world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with data requires ‘a deep appreciation for &lt;em&gt;what is possible&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what will&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;soon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;be possible&lt;/em&gt;’  (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/12a305d5eaad&quot;&gt;Trey Causey&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@treycausey/rise-of-the-data-product-manager-2fb9961b21d1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with other departments is an eye-opener&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oh mate, Brexit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Unity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An overarching feeling on oneness this week. A good team lunch, some get-togethers with good folk, and nice vibes all round really. That’ll continue into the weekend, whether it’s wandering the South Downs Way or skanking to to a mate’s jungle set at Carnival. But without further ado, here’s what I got up to this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procuring funds and commissioning talent takes time. Trying to do it fast is possible, but it’s a lot of running around. I did &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of running around, meeting people and typing words, to get some support for one of our products. Should it be easier and quicker? I don’t know, perhaps not. Should it really involve product managers? Mmm, yeah, definitely. You need that space to mentally and physically commit to sub-contracting work, and understand what it means financially, economically and strategically to have another team pick up that effort. It’s just that spending 6 hours a day typing into Google Docs is one of the unglamorous but essential parts of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Pr07KCPVpvmLXxLpBem7UA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But between that, I spent the other main currency of product management: time in meetings, with 30 minutes alongside my fellows in ProductBuro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;u wot m8?&lt;/em&gt; Ah, well, ProductBuro is a council of product managers from across the community at GDS, focussed on organising and delivering sessions for the community. It’s been happening organically since &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/bb88a6d5fb68&quot;&gt;Ross Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; was artfully poached by Canadian Digital Service – a highly prized moose head to mount on your product team – led by Martin and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/cc3d51c2495a&quot;&gt;Chantal Foyer&lt;/a&gt; (with assistance from others whom I shamefully forget). The aim is to lead the community from within, provide support across programmes and give the PMs chance to bond, learn from each other, share stories and tips, and spur the community onwards – something Ross was incredible at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nominated myself along with fellow weeknoter &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/86da9a49c10b&quot;&gt;Richard Walker&lt;/a&gt;, the ebullient &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lrnthom&quot;&gt;Lauren&lt;/a&gt;, and the creative Neil (he named the group). Despite expecting some pomp and ritual, we weren’t elected to the posts and our good intent was enough, so hopefully we’ll do the community proud. Having said that, it’s not like we have any special powers, it’s mostly organising things and giving people chance to learn more, which is quite nice. Anyway, the we’ll see how the first meet-up goes! In the meantime, we need to induct the new PMs into the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the quarterly mission structure is defining &lt;a href=&quot;https://marcabraham.com/2018/06/05/book-review-radical-focus/&quot;&gt;objectives and key results (OKRs)&lt;/a&gt;, which we set out for quarter 3. We set a bold, qualitative goal for the end of the quarter and define how we’ll reach that with four to five measurable, tangible key results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team’s mission at Platform Health is to operate and maintain a stable, scalable and secure platform. It’s pretty secure and relatively stable, but the stack of technology needs some work making it scalable to current and future demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set that as the objective for next quarter, and we’ll know we’ve achieved it when we’ve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moved to the cloud,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set and met &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@asuffield/thinking-about-slos-64841737d1ed&quot;&gt;service level objectives&lt;/a&gt; for publishing, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;made alerting less noisy and more relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those key results have KPIs for product (we’ll know we’re done when we’ve add &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; amount of value) and delivery (we’ll know we’re done when we’ve created &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; concept or thing). &lt;em&gt;Why all that fluff and the weapons-grade acronyms?&lt;/em&gt; Because keeping it all in your head is hard, and knowing when you’ve realistically achieved all you could is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried a new thing with our team Show &amp;amp; Tell: lightning talks on what you’ve been working on. It’s a simple concept. People take 3–5 minutes sharing their work, whether that’s a new application, the finer details of a pull request, knowledge or research. Anything really, but mostly to share context: the unit of delivery is the team, so spread knowledge in more detail because stand-ups aren’t enough. It seemed to go well but we’ll see if there’s any way we can iterate on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must call myself out for some bad practice though. During &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/technicalnotices&quot;&gt;a big publishing event&lt;/a&gt; later on, I got involved without being asked, and possibly just added extra noise. The team would have found the solution anyway, so my buzzing around was pointless. No one’s complained about it, it’s just that I wasn’t needed, so should have stayed away. An important lesson to learn though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned, I moved on to where my input &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; needed, in a meeting with the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simoneverest&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;. We’re going to help a department with a thorny thing, and he was very, very relieved, because now he can think about the rest of their Brexit thornbush. And theirs is fucking massive, to be fair. This work will give me time to think about a consultancy model for ‘selling’ our products into other transformation programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another good check-in with the programme team. I don’t know what’s happening this quarter but most things seem to be working out. We’re making progress, we’re confident we can deliver the key results, and we know what’s coming up. We’ve found our flow maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They provided good challenge though, and that’s what we want: prompt us to consider the wider impact of our work, and check our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday I got the chance to visit the Product team at Ordnance Survey. Michael, their strategic product manager, explained what they do, their markets and the arms of the business, and their long term strategy. They’re a robust team with great product thinking, and though I had no idea what to expect I left seriously impressed. We mused on shared challenges in the product space and, if I’m quite honest, it would be good to work there once I’m done with London. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mapbox.com/ordnance-survey-launches-vector-maps-for-great-britain-e096c2413139&quot;&gt;Open Zoomstack, their cool mapping app&lt;/a&gt;. Really grateful for them hosting us. Thanks, Michael and team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were there to talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.gov.uk&quot;&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;, which I don’t manage but do have experience in data: open, geospatial, linked and standardised. It was nice to get back into that world, and it turns out that four years listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/c8c40c52174f&quot;&gt;Mike Thacker&lt;/a&gt; is an exceptional education in its opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people across the open data space are bought into the vision of data.gov.uk and I know Martin, though the odds may feel stacked up against him, is a choice person to lead it onwards. There’s a community of people doing fabulous work out there, and government can have trust in it. Wouldn’t mind lending a hand, if I can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Only sit at the table if you’re bringing something we all need&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recipes we made that we liked, either borrowed or invented&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peach, Gorgonzola and quinoa salad with sherry vinegar dressing (this one needs work, peppery rocket instead of pea shoots and the peaches need griddling)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Boost</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After last week’s slump, it was good to escape that trough and ascend new heights this week. It’s a good reminder of the cyclical nature of things, the natural highs and lows, and how being mindful of those gives you opportunity to change tack – if needs be. It’s another benefit of weeknoting, being able to package up a period of time and conclude your thoughts on it, draw a line in the sand and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than five things happened&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a GOV.UK away day. It was good to hang out with people I’ve not worked with before and there were great presentations from others in GDS, most notably from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/4c95e6ca7491&quot;&gt;Alistair Duggin&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Accessibility. He’s put together a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles&quot;&gt;user profiles for disabilities and impairments&lt;/a&gt; to use when designing services and products. It’s a great resource for people across government and anyone else in service design or tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also covered how we can meet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps&quot;&gt;new regulations for public sector websites’ accessibility&lt;/a&gt;, for which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/20/creating-the-uk-governments-accessibility-empathy-lab/&quot;&gt;Empathy Lab&lt;/a&gt; is hugely effective. Having never used screen readers before or had a visual impairment, it helps you experience the benefits of accessible design on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t do any strategic, future-vision stuff though people were expecting that. With a quarterly mission structure, we’re updated on where we’re headed quite regularly, but perhaps people are blind to that. As a PM community we’re doing lots of roadmapping at the moment, so I’ll plump for that being played back to teams. (I’d also like to make it open to the public, I just need an affirmative response to an email.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each fortnight, the product manager community of GOV.UK gets together to chat strategy, tools of practice, methods, opportunities and more. It helps us all keep aligned with each other and the unit stays abreast of industry developments in product management. This week we explored the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/clay-christensen-the-theory-of-jobs-to-be-done&quot;&gt;Jobs to be Done framework&lt;/a&gt; with our User Insights Lead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/f55ce5f16fec&quot;&gt;Imeh Akpan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something I’ve found helpful in the past – especially when trying to work out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/blog/where-do-you-suck-where-does-it-matter/&quot;&gt;what product improvements to make when your backlog’s beefy&lt;/a&gt; – but with an entire country to create user personas for, Jobs to be Done helps us better empathise with what a user is trying to achieve on www.gov.uk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be exciting to develop this thinking further, especially as we try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/27/building-the-gov-uk-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;fuel the reciprocal relationship between users and government&lt;/a&gt; that can happen on the site. It’ll give us opportunities to develop true innovations in democracy both on– and offline. Most jobs are triggered in the real world, and we’re thinking more about the end-to-end journey people take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did more research into request tracing for the publishing pipeline, and we wrote a blog post about what we’ve done thus far. (Hopefully it’ll be published next week!) But we’ve done a full audit of the tools available, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opentracing.io/&quot;&gt;an open standard we can use&lt;/a&gt; to reduce switching costs, and worked out how much each tool will cost us as it records HTTP requests across the publishing stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUIZ TIME! How many HTTP requests do applications in the GOV.UK publishing pipeline get each week? Answer: ~109 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boy is taken aback. Much like we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I caught up with our delivery manager as the first half of the quarter has passed, so we’re looking ahead to the next. They were really complimentary on some of my work, but they also gave me challenges for making improvements – mainly on my outwardly perceived attitude. This sort of criticism is really welcome and I’m glad they brought it up, as I do have a tendency to be blunt or seem unhappy. But that’s not fair when you’re leading a team and people rely on you, so I’ve got to be more mindful of that. After some tough talk, I was shocked but overwhelmingly pleased to be told I’d been nominated for a bonus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two good reality checks in one lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was full of future thinking. Working on backlogs for the platform suite of products, thinking about missions for quarters 3 and 4, and how we can do agency-style work with departments as clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re refining our OKR approach to mission work. We set wide objectives for making improvements to the platform, break those down into specific missions to achieve outcomes, and measure the success of those with key results. We also set KPIs against the key results, to measure whether we need to do more or less work on those missions. It’ll &lt;a href=&quot;http://theleanstartup.com/principles&quot;&gt;bring more experimentation into our product development&lt;/a&gt;, which is really exciting and how other contemporary product organisations work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this got me thinking about the long-term strategy for GOV.UK and our place in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/&quot;&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt;. The Voice and SEO missions have edged us closer to that, but I’ve started thinking about other ways to slice our data warehouse. GOV.UK is one of many records of the history of government in the UK – we need to make it understandable to machines, and build ways for products to be developed on top of its output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the way, we’re looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=cGFnZWNsYXNzPUpvYnMmY3NvdXJjZT1jc3FzZWFyY2gmam9ibGlzdF92aWV3X3ZhYz0xNTI2MDE3JnVzZXJzZWFyY2hjb250ZXh0PTYxOTkyODEzJnBhZ2VhY3Rpb249dmlld3ZhY2J5am9ibGlzdCZvd25lcj01MDcwMDAwJm93bmVydHlwZT1mYWlyJnNlYXJjaF9zbGljZV9jdXJyZW50PTEmcmVxc2lnPTE1MzQ1MzMyNDUtYjU5M2NjYzEzY2ZlMGI2ZjJmNTcxZWExY2VlYjhjYjAxMjMwODdiNQ==&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=dXNlcnNlYXJjaGNvbnRleHQ9NjE5OTI4MTMmcGFnZWFjdGlvbj12aWV3dmFjYnlqb2JsaXN0Jm93bmVyPTUwNzAwMDAmc2VhcmNoX3NsaWNlX2N1cnJlbnQ9MSZvd25lcnR5cGU9ZmFpciZwYWdlY2xhc3M9Sm9icyZjc291cmNlPWNzcXNlYXJjaCZqb2JsaXN0X3ZpZXdfdmFjPTE1MjU5ODEmcmVxc2lnPTE1MzQ1MzMyNDUtYjU5M2NjYzEzY2ZlMGI2ZjJmNTcxZWExY2VlYjhjYjAxMjMwODdiNQ==&quot;&gt;senior developers&lt;/a&gt; – get onboard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on Friday I chatted with my line manager about the possibilities of promotion. I’m working to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/product-manager-skills-they-need/product-manager-skills-they-need&quot;&gt;levels of competency expected of product managers&lt;/a&gt; in our DDaT Framework, but a job needs to be created before I can apply and interview for it. And I shouldn’t assume I’d be the best candidate, but I do feel ready. Not sure how it’ll go but I’ve got my fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also managed to encourage our delivery manager to write about the team culture they’re fostering, so keep an eye out for that blog. Thinking out loud about their work and blogging was the channel through which I learned about and was attracted to GDS, it’s sad that &lt;a href=&quot;https://daibach.uk/2018/02/state-blogging-digital-government/&quot;&gt;it has declined&lt;/a&gt;. But hopefully we can cause a ripple of new, more frequent writing to ebb out of our teams’ work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Farewell</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was all over the shop mentally. On Friday I had to just bed down in work with headphones on, but all-in-all it’s been another good week. We lost a good member of the team, but the weeknotes community has proven itself incredible yet again. Happy to say that we even managed to attract &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknotes-1-861986b7907e?source=linkShare-c74615cf75ab-1533988229&quot;&gt;someone new to the crew&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than four things happened&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday and Tuesday were filled with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/introduction-and-basic-training-days-for-user-research-for-government-services/&quot;&gt;introduction and basic training days for user research for government services&lt;/a&gt;. Though I’m no stranger to the practice (and have written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/please-give-me-another-chance-f1a1555c8974&quot;&gt;what happens when you don’t do user research&lt;/a&gt;), I wanted to see if the context of working in government changed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out it doesn’t, not by much. User research is such a robust, worthy field of work that you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; reap the rewards by taking time to listen to what people need. The core concept is to reduce wasted effort and time by building the right thing, what people need not what they want. The only difference with user research in government is that you can’t be selective with your user personas: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#this-is-for-everyone&quot;&gt;this is for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. In the private sector your personas focus around people who’ll drive your revenue, but not so in government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only criticism of the course is that I don’t feel enough time was spent on eliminating bias. During the activities and practice sessions, the research questions were tainted by bias – designed to validate assumptions rather than invalidate, leading one to an expected answer – and user stories ended up being solutionistic. It’s no fault of the course leaders, they had lots to cover for an audience relatively new to a complex field, but I’ll pass on the feedback. Bias is one of the more difficult topics, but this article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/cognitive-biases-that-affect-decisions-2015-8&quot;&gt;cognitive biases that affect decisions&lt;/a&gt; is gold-dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Someone also told the story of how they’d seen several teams conduct research &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; delivering a project, as a checkbox exercise to get past the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard&quot;&gt;Service Standard&lt;/a&gt;. It’s appalling behaviour and will come back to bite them, as it did me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having read how I’d been wrangling with someone unfamiliar to how we do things at GDS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/e5e58b4f7364&quot;&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt; offered some advice over lunch. It was really on-the-money and will help me adapt to this person’s way of thinking. What I really need to do is sell the benefits of our approach to working, but it’s unfair to do that without hearing theirs and their motivations for joining GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spoke about how the organisation is changing, what that means for product management, and the importance of communicating to stakeholders that some times they don’t know best. Ellie’s really talented and I’m glad she was able to spend some time helping me, so I must offer to give some back. And it just went to prove how supportive the weeknotes community can be – she even gave me a weeknotes sticker! Thanks, Ellie 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We said goodbye to Paul B. His knowledge of our stack is inimitable, but he did an incredible job of passing that on – and rewriting heaps of the dev docs. We’re going to really miss him, he was a stalwart of the tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an excellent check-in with the programme team. They’re pleased with the team’s work, but most amazingly they’re open to us descoping some of our objectives. That’s thanks to my colleague, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinlugton.com&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, who’s taken the time to see what’s achievable, what’s needed, and broken it down into a good strategy. There’s a lot going on there, so I hope he won’t mind passing the reins over to me, I’m happy to pick up more work. (He did it for during GDPR, which was well needed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And despite a few worries about team health previously, right now it’s really good. The team are engaged with their work, they really care about it, and they’re asking all the right questions during planning. This is no doubt due to our fabulous delivery manager (whom I won’t name as they’re not on social media) who has made it their mission to create space us to think, ensure everyone’s priorities are accounted for, and injects vivacity and enthusiasm into our daily lives (to boot!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with them both these past few months has been a treat and the sort of training you don’t get most places. I’m intrigued to know which principles drive their work, the maxims they call on to move through the day. They could help me as I progress, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government transformation is a massive undertaking with many minds to help adapt to new ways of working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re really privileged in GOV.UK to have been on the frontline of transformation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The weeknotes crewdem is 👌&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multidisciplinary working is a treat when it works well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be careful of hubris: communicating your pride to others is an exercise in humility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-imcooking&quot;&gt;What I’m Cooking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kedgeree with smoked haddock and watercress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asparagus, sweet pea and burrata frittata (should have added basil oil to the pea shoot salad)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Globe courgette stuffed with spicy rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Step Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Surprised myself this week by how much I handled it all. Everything feels like it’s fitting together well, and despite one minor wobbler I held it together. But most importantly, there’s a sense we’re making actual progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being skint, I bought tickets to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozillafestival.org/tickets&quot;&gt;MozFest 2018&lt;/a&gt; to find out where the Web is heading. 13-year-old Steve would be very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My return flight from Venice on Sunday was delayed by several hours, meaning I didn’t get in to bed until 3.30 a.m. Took the morning off and rolled in at lunch time. Completely failed to clear my inbox except for a few unimportant messages, but I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; manage to catch up on the previous week’s events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated to but alongside a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neillyneil/status/1022119555265712130&quot;&gt;pretty major announcement&lt;/a&gt;, I was told about our deteriorating team health – both work-induced and general illness. We also talked about how to share good practice or stories of failure in the team, which got us thinking about team culture and leadership from within. I’ve always been a fan of CharlieHR’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.charliehr.com/tag/culturelab/&quot;&gt;CultureLab&lt;/a&gt; and wondered how we might set up our own. &lt;em&gt;If you have any interesting stories from the tech world, dear reader, please do share tales and links with me.&lt;/em&gt; First we’ll tinker with retros, and I’d like to encourage more blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ended well, though, with a huddle on the pipeline work. It turns out the team had engaged with the discovery well, but we weren’t out of the trenches yet. We met to look at options, pick over them, and it raised questions about whether our work would be for short-term gains or long-term scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s something I’ll need to ponder tomorrow on a better night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A packed Tuesday, a standard for my working week, wherein I failed to reach Inbox Zero again. Tons of meetings happened, and I had to prepare slides for our Show &amp;amp; Tell during lunch, which meant I was pretty pooped when it got to pre-planning. But there’s a much better sense of where we’re headed now: we got used to the ebbs and flows of working on a stretched WebOps team last quarter, and planning is less worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another boon is having a workstream to call our own. I presented the discovery-esque work we’d done so far at the Show &amp;amp; Tell, which seemed to go down well. There were murmurs of support from the tech community, its lead architect especially, DataOps, and the team making improvements to the publisher experience were receptive to our creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love for the team to get some feelings of achievement out of the pipeline work this quarter, to be able to say they’ve made serious improvements to the beating heart of GOV.UK, but I’m reticent to push too hard – and we need to consider the long-term effects and scalability of our solutions. It’s going to need some tact, foresight and comfort with having tough conversations. But first we’ll research all the options on the table. (A good night’s sleep helped after all, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2QFHWiIMEbWmmI3iQoHVJ0&quot;&gt;this album&lt;/a&gt; by jazz/hip-hop/dub keyboardist &amp;amp; SE Londoner Joe Armon-Jones is a bonus.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was a day of highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inbox Zero! 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good planning session with the full team! 👌&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A progressive retro! 🆙&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team health is good! 😁&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ran a retro for the first time, and people were engaged! 😊&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People sympathise with how much effort our work takes! 😎 &lt;em&gt;At least enough to retweet/like this a bunch of times anyway!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lovely to bump into &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/f30ef58c4490&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the day and talk #weeknotes, how cathartic the practice can be, and the importance of reflection in a job that moves a million miles an hour. Her prose is much classier than mine, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknote-e1-s1-enchantment-beats-burn-out-d0712bf698b3&quot;&gt;have a gander&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Thursday wasn’t too bad either. We had some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neillyneil/status/1024943393913364480&quot;&gt;wise words from Neil&lt;/a&gt; to kick off the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatting to Elliot about the work he’d done on request tracing a couple of years ago was really beneficial. He’d actually got quite far into implementing something useful, but priorities changed and the work was dropped. Later on we searched through our wiki, looked at archived Trello boards, and dredged up old gists and PRs – we found all his work, which means we can pick it up again next sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll hit the ground running on the pipeline work, starting from where he left off, heading towards our renewed priorities. I must make sure to record all the thinking and doing from this work, in case someone else needs to run with it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, Friday was good apart from one hour meeting with a stakeholder. They’re relatively new to the organisation but, from what I can tell, also oblivious to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles&quot;&gt;government design principles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/how-user-research-improves-service-design&quot;&gt;user research&lt;/a&gt;, and any notion that we build with qual/quant data – based on real need – not just whims and fancies. We do not use our time and the public purse to make ineffectual gains. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/17/6-case-studies-using-research-and-data-to-improve-a-live-service/&quot;&gt;use research and data&lt;/a&gt; to improve a live product, not bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrangling this person is incredibly stressful – even a fellow senior PM was finding it hard – and I had to take a tea break to chill afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was the silver lining. Wont to get stressed, forgetting to take a step back at times, I took a few moments to decompress and move on. And the rest of the afternoon sailed by with jollity and ease. We even got a shout-out on the programme weeknote, which capped off what was, on the whole, one of my best weeks yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GobletofWisdom/status/1022770159331815424&quot;&gt;You are a human being, not a human doing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pebbledash presentations lightly with humour – it makes it easier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even ‘boring’ work needs good PR. Be an ambassador for your team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge management is a good thing, but I don’t yet do enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a step back before you fall into the maelstrom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-imcooking&quot;&gt;What I’m Cooking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fabada asturiana (white beans, chorizo &amp;amp; black pudding stew)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pornstar purée (a home-made rip-off of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laurasanttini.com/collection/taste-5-bomba-xxx&quot;&gt;Bomba! XXX&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog chili dogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Though I’ve always meant to journal my cooking, I never got around to it and it’s ended up here. Some times I’ll cook nice things, other times it’ll just be comfort classics (which I won’t record unless they’re exciting). But if you ever want a recipe for these, ping me – and prod me if I forget to send one over.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Discovery</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These weeknotes come to you belatedly, as I was on holiday on Friday and spent the weekend celebrating my 30th with friends. It’s still a great practice though, helping me tie up the week and reflect on what happened. Makes me wish I’d been doing it earlier, there’s so much from building &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecasework.com/&quot;&gt;eCasework&lt;/a&gt; I could have shared. Thank you to the weeknotes folks for your kind words and encouragement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started out as a packed day ended up being free; meetings moved around giving me time to think. It’s important to have that time to process things, to actually do the work of a PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we had an incident review – a meeting covering the causes and solutions of a technical incident – which has given us more reason to work on the publishing pipeline this quarter. As mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknotes-s01e01-4b9623872485&quot;&gt;last weeknote&lt;/a&gt;, I’m keen we take on that work, and the consensus in the room was that we needed it now. With a major national event on the horizon, ensuring the pipeline can reliably deliver content is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s varying levels of experience in the team and I’d been planning on holding a mapping session followed by some problem sorting. After that we could implement some request tracking to measure the pipeline, to find out where the bottlenecks were, and then jump into making changes. Tech leads and senior devs thought that my approach was sound and that we &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to build collective understanding – it was comforting to hear my thinking validated, in some part. Many in the team know how to tweak things to fix them, but don’t know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; to tweak those things or by how much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders&quot;&gt;Andy Dudfield&lt;/a&gt;, Service Owner at ONS Digital, popped in to chat to the GOV.UK product manager community about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;ONS website&lt;/a&gt; and how it had been transformed over the last couple of years. I’d originally invited him in to hear about all the work they’d been doing on data, to help us think about data.gov.uk, but there were lots of questions from the community about the general website too. It was super pleasing that everyone was so engaged, there was lots of food for thought on the next steps for GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy’s presentation and the work at ONS Digital – kicked off by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/fb24db1416c3&quot;&gt;@jukesie&lt;/a&gt;’s work, which Andy was keen to point out – gave the PMs corroboration on our thoughts about user personas, DataOps, SEO, the definition of the term open data, and how to engage generalist audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we chatted about the campaigns platform and how ONS might use it for the upcoming census. It’ll be good to have their needs shape the product alongside upcoming EU Exit work, to help avoid feature-bloat and keep the platform’s utility more general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about how we define a product’s success in the public sector can be tough. Programmes and transformation are designed to effect change, but a digital product is propelled by metrics. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Product-For-Good/&quot;&gt;Product for Good&lt;/a&gt; meetup on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Product-For-Good/events/251514601/&quot;&gt;defining metrics for social impact&lt;/a&gt; provided great insight from the tech for good community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How can you turn qualitative comments into something you can measure quantitatively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/a72dfd06845b&quot;&gt;Matt Kepple&lt;/a&gt; from Makerble has done lots of thinking on scaling impact measurement and trying to measure in the short term, where indicators are more attributable to your efforts. He said that changing what people do, think or have are the three types of impact story or behavioural change that you can influence. It touched on thoughts I’d been having back in February and raised in our 52 Weeks of UX lean coffee about measuring emotional impact. I’ll be able to develop that blog post more now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we set aside two hours to map out the publishing pipeline and its problem space. It was my first time leading a discovery-esque approach to a live ‘product’ (arguably the platform is an assembly of products), but it went well. Our experienced developers shared knowledge amongst the team, gaps were filled in by others, and the new team members brought new ideas to the table. Following on from a tech intro the previous week, I was able to qualify my understanding of how it all fits together, which was pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we had a discussion on what problems we’d been facing and why, and the conclusion was that we can’t say for certain: we need good metrics to help expose where the bottlenecks lie. Though I had been directing conversation that way to a degree – the Build-Measure-Learn loop is central to hypothesis-driven development – it was great that Paul, previously the programme’s tech lead, called for this. We’ll also be able to take a look at work Elliot had done a couple of years back on request tracking, which will not only inform us but could help rebuild trust in the publisher community. ‘Getting two birds stoned at once,’ as &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Jfq3c4Cf1Fs?t=162&quot;&gt;Ricky says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excited to see how conversations have developed when I get back from holiday next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop making new things. Start making old things work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out and meet people. We have a great community in gov.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s other communities you can learn from too!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oh heck, I love this job.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Reshuffle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading people’s weeknotes was one of the main inspirations for me to join the Civil Service. It sounded like an exciting world, and on my first day at GDS I wrote some notes. I just never got around to publishing them…and I didn’t carry on writing notes. But when &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/27dad6d7c304&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; joined our team a few weeks ago, he encouraged me to give it another go, so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-thathappened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked off quarter two with a relatively unchanged team and a refreshed enthusiasm for the coming three months. I combed through our backlog to reprioritise cards and clear some clutter. It was a good start and needs more work, it’s important we manage the team’s scope this quarter. Context-switching is not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-44762836&quot;&gt;Monday’s news&lt;/a&gt; gave us some good perspective on the epics would could take on this quarter. Having already plumped for one option but been met with uncertainty, a later incident review gave us a good steer – and straight after that, another change to the machinery of government helped us reshuffle our priorities. There’s clear value for us to bring which aids stakeholders and end users, whilst building our knowledge of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though my job title only says ‘associate product manager’, I’m leading the product thinking on a few workstreams this quarter. To make me a better leader, I’ve set myself some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be approachable but not constantly interruptible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speak more slowly, and think with purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help people spot opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Assembly, where I did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/education/product-management&quot;&gt;product management course&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, have taken me on as a teaching assistant! 🙌 This is really exciting for a number of reasons. The TA on my course was helpful in explaining points which the class didn’t fully understand, and he brought a lot of experience to the table. Our tutor was running his own startup but the TA worked Product in a bank, and it was beneficial to hear stories from that perspective. Can’t wait to share my experiences from &lt;a href=&quot;https://porism.com/&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly I’m grateful to have a little refresher on their current curriculum. It’s always iterating based on the nature of this ever-evolving practice, and I’m keen to see how they see the role developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had some good 1-on-1s with the more seasoned members of the team. Kim Scott says that ‘the hardest part of building trust is inviting people to challenge you’, but given my relative greenness on the programme, I asked them to provide critical challenge when they felt it necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one person knows the perfect path for achieving our goals. It’s why we have a retrospective, to reflect on what happened and how to improve next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve started planning our major proactive health epic for the quarter. Since there’s a range of experiences on the team and the problem space isn’t super clear, I’m kicking things off with a discovery to build our knowledge of how applications tie together. We’ll then map out the problem space for the health epic, allowing us to start validating (or invalidating) our riskiest assumptions and making improvements to the behemoth that is GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really invigorating as our team can be seen as having a support or WebOps role, when really we own a product that is the beating heart of the website. We’ll be viewing the work through the lens of exiting the EU, when responsiveness will be key to communicating changes to the nation effectively. And though no one jumps at the chance to record metrics, taking a lean approach to product improvement is essential to ensure you’re working on the right things. Build, measure, learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and someone asked me to make a presentation about the history of the Web and how it works (for non-techies) 😍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was good to take stock and reflect on what we actually do at GOV.UK, what our purpose is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s my job to create more joy and less misery in the team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re never done learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humanity is essential to building the so-called soft skills of product management&lt;/li&gt;
