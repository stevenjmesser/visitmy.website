      <p><p>A common feature of my weeknotes was to share some bookmarks – things I’d been reading that week. Since writing <a href="/2021/07/03/the-last-weeknote/">my last weeknote</a>, my reading (and writing) has declined, as I’ve been working very busily during the day and taking it easy the rest of the time. But now that I’m nearing autonomy in the day job, I’ll have a bit more time to read and write again.</p>
