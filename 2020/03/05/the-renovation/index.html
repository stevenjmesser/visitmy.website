    <p>Reducing the amount of time I spend thinking about work outside of work is having its benefits, so I’m only gonna chat about ‘personal things’. My mental health is improving by working on it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Parasite</em> is a bit good, eh? The way Bong Joon Ho seamlessly stitched together different genres and moods throughout the story was masterful. After chatting to a friend who lived in South Korea for a while, I learned that it’s a fairly common storytelling technique in their culture: extraordinary stories in common settings. I think that’s why it worked so well. (I preferred <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/parasite-review.html">the NY Times review</a> to the Guardian’s.)</li>
  <li>Went to see <em>1917</em> the following week too, which is emotive and gut-wrenching and shocking all in one. People who’ve played <em>Call of Duty</em> will get it immediately. Maybe avoid it if you’re stressed out though, it’ll have your veins pumped full of cortisol in no time.</li>
  <li>The only other single-track film I’ve seen is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4226388/"><em>Victoria</em></a>, which I caught a trailer for a few years ago and saw on a whim. It turned out to be one of the best films I’ve ever seen, possibly knocking <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117407/"><em>Pusher</em></a> off the top spot.</li>
  <li>If you’re a GDS person, watch this documentary about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00t3f42/ours-to-keep-incomers">Spitalfields’ decaying Georgian houses</a> and the 1980s effort to restore them.</li>
  <li><em>Bass, Mids, Tops</em> continues to deliver on providing me with new sounds to listen to. I’ve been enjoying Adrian Sherwood’s repertoire and his <a href="http://on-usound.com">On-U Sound label</a>. Dubby, playful with music tech, celebratory of soundsystem culture. The <a href="https://onusound.bleepstores.com/artist/45578-doctor-pablo-the-dub-syndicate">Doctor Pablo</a> stuff is cracking.</li>
  <li>As a result, there’s a few dub tracks in my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1In4kMSguQDCi7UVam8J88?si=Bh_MqGZHQ4mV3NfJFv151g&amp;_php=1">February playlist</a>, alongside new British jazz supremo Moses Boyd, a new Legowelt, Ashley Henry and a fuzzy, blues number.</li>
  <li>I’ve been re-reading <a href="http://leanuxbook.com"><em>Lean UX</em></a> to give me a boost at work, and that’s been really helpful.</li>
  <li>Started the <a href="https://www.ideou.com/products/designing-strategy">designing strategy course</a> from IDEO last week, it’s so good. Not too dissimilar to Lean methods, to be honest, but I slightly different framework to suit any business context, not just digital products. Loving it so far.</li>
  <li>Ordered <a href="http://www.krksys.com">KRKs</a>, which I’ve been meaning to do for like 12 years. Can’t wait to hear tunes through those speakers!</li>
  <li>Thinking about the below quote from Andrew Weatherall, maybe weeknotes are good for sharing but not for active thinking.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We live in a world where every minute is documented, so there’s not so much room to mythologise anything.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Despite that, and in response to the quote below, I am going to say that the resurgence of rave culture is more about fashion than an actual backlash against the times we live in.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>After years of fragmentation and polarisation, the joyful militancy of early rave feels poignant; the kind of unified response to political strife that this era is yet to produce.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>I’m going to redesign this website soon: get rid of the Javascript, make it accessible, learn Sass so that I can actually tweak the frontend. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll">Barber</a> as the theme currently but feel like making my own.</li>
  <li>Since we’re on the cusp of an epidemic and I’ve got a bad cold, I’m isolating myself at home. Prevents other people catching it, but also tension and paranoia abounds on public transport. The slightest sniffle and people are alarmed.</li>
</ul>
