    <p>Again, these are personal weeknotes. I know most of you come here for the work tidbits, so sorry about that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being locked up for 3 days was quite hard, so by Saturday (7th) I really wanted to get out of the house. The problem was that coincided with my bodyâ€™s excessive mucus production, making it hard to hide the fact I was ill in public. By chance, I happened to find the perfect cover: spicy phá»Ÿ. Everyone sniffs and coughs when eating hot, spicy soup. (Does you good too.)</li>
  <li>Wandered down alongside the Thames. I love it there and used to walk it a lot when I lived close to <a href="https://boroughphotos.org/lewisham/st-nicholas-church-deptford-47/">St Nicholas church in Deptford</a>. Never often made it past the <a href="https://www.cuttysarkse10.co.uk">Cutty Sark pub</a>, though, and Iâ€™ve been missing out.</li>
  <li>The highlight was Richard Wilsonâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Slice_of_Reality"><em>A Slice of Reality</em></a>, especially eerie because a radio was playing inside the ship, though I could have sworn that no one was aboard. It reminded me of passages in <em>Doggerland</em>, the book I was reading a few weeks ago.</li>
  <li>Not fancying reading more of <em>Lean UX</em> on a Sunday, I hunted out a podcast about naval history but couldnâ€™t find anything to suit. So instead I tried to find one about Greenwichâ€™s naval history. There was a 30-minute show on BBC Sounds but nothing else. It mentioned Samuel Pepys though, and I remembered I hadnâ€™t read his diary yet.</li>
  <li>Anyway, Iâ€™m now 330-odd chapters through the audiobook. Iâ€™m still quite surprised that his diary is where I ended up after seeking out a podcast about Britainâ€™s adventures on the sea, but low and behold heâ€™s actually on a ship now. So maybe it was the right thing.</li>
  <li>Mad to think that there wasnâ€™t really a ruling monarch in 1660. Looking forward to hearing how he deals with the plague too, as people have already made comparisons between that and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cyz0z8w0ydwt/coronavirus-outbreak">our own epidemic</a>.</li>
  <li>My new speakers arrived on Friday (6th) and Iâ€™ve been enjoying them an awful lot. Much more fidelty, the frequencies are treated properly, and thereâ€™s elements to songs I hadnâ€™t picked up on before.</li>
  <li>Monday evening (9th) served up a treat: Ashley Henry live-scored scenes from space at the Royal Observatory. They called it <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/see-do/exhibitions-events/space-jams-royal-observatory-feat-ashley-henry-live-scored-planetarium-experience">â€˜space jamsâ€™</a>. It was a new experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot, though at times the visuals werenâ€™t quantised with the music. Maybe itâ€™d work better if the music were properly arranged rather than improvised.</li>
  <li>I booked tickets for <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1399212">Livity Sound at Mickâ€™s Garage</a> but itâ€™ll probably get cancelledâ€¦which is a shame as Peverelist B2B Pinch is just ðŸ˜™ðŸ‘Œ</li>
  <li>Went to see Moses Boyd at Electric Brixton on Thursday (12th), and I dunno if Iâ€™ve <em>ever</em> seen a drummer lead a band like that. Also, I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s fair to call him a jazz musician, feels like it boxes him in too much. Yes, itâ€™s inspired by jazz but he plays with influences from electronic music so much. The lighting was rad too.</li>
  <li>Fell into an internet hole looking at the history of civil defence in the UK. Itâ€™s quite amazing.</li>

<p>These notes cover a few weeks, rather than one week like usual. Writing weeknotes in the pandemic just didnâ€™t feel necessary, but thereâ€™s a few things worth noting from the last five weeks of lockdown.</p>
