It’ll help you consider which pieces of work are worth sharing and talking about. You might even build up a few stories per sprint to talk about.

Weeknotes are personal reflections on your working week to learn from what you’ve done and improve your practice from week to week. You simply write about what you’ve done and how you feel about how it went.</p><p>There’s an excellent community on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23weeknotes">#weeknotes</a> hashtag on Twitter who can give you ideas, but you can also just ask for help. They’re super friendly.</p><p>It’s worth saying that blogging isn’t an easy thing to start, you’ll probably get ‘the fear’ about receiving criticism on your work or thoughts. But that’s fine, my advice is to just dive in and have a go. Usually your fears don’t match reality, and there’s <a href="https://weeknot.es">an amazing community</a> there to comment and help if you’re struggling anyway.</p><p>You don’t need any money to get started, really, you can spin up a blog in minutes using platforms like <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>. It’s a quick way to test out the practice and see if it’s right for you.</p><p>If you’d like to create your own website, static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> are low-tech ways to get started. You might have heard of <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> which runs on Jekyll. You simply feed it some Markdown files and it builds a website for you. GitHub Pages is free too, and it’s a good way to become more familiar with Git in general.</p><p>And you needn’t worry about having to promote your blog posts either. Services like <a href="https://lttr.ai/Mg8L">Missinglettr</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://quuu.co/promote">Quuu Promote</a> will syndicate your blog posts on social media automatically, helping your posts to get a greater reach.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/self-facilitating-media-node.gif" alt="A scene from Nathan Barley" /></p><p>You may become a self-facilitating media node.
