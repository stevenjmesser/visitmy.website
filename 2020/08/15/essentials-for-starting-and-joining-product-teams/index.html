    <p>Over the years I’ve managed several product teams, always from first principles, and as I’ve matured as a product manager I’ve written a few memos to myself. Things that got us over a hump or feedback I received from colleagues. Every so often I’ll glance back at these memos to remind myself how to do things well. These are the must-haves and key things to remember which help me start or join a product team and hit the ground running, which I use in conjunction with this list of <a href="/2020/09/06/things-to-do-as-a-new-product-manager/">things to do as a new product manager</a>.</p>

<p><em>This is a living list, so it might change. Check back every now and then.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-foundational-principle">The foundational principle</h2>

<p>As product manager, you look after the environment that the team needs to succeed, making sure we all have a clear view of what success looks like and how we’ll get there. Give them space to collaborate and facilitate them in making decisions.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-the-basics">Start with the basics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is the product or service?</li>
  <li>What problem does it solve? Write that down in plain language.</li>
  <li>What is the outcome we want users<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to reach? What is the outcome we want users to avoid?</li>
  <li>What are the pain points preventing users reaching their outcome?</li>
  <li>Which of those points is most painful and needs removing first? Which one next?</li>
  <li>What are the unknowns (discovery)? What are the knowns (delivery)?</li>
  <li>Where’s the documentation? You’ll need to update it each week, if someone else doesn’t do that already.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-in-a-team">Working in a team</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Set up a regular check-in with your delivery manager, twice a week if possible.</li>
  <li>Make sure pre-planning is 2 days before planning, giving ample time to refine cards and user stories.</li>
  <li>Pre-planning should involve tech lead, design lead, and delivery manager (at least).</li>
  <li>Don’t risk doing the classic retro mistake of trying to change everything after one sprint.</li>
  <li>Figure out your team’s skillset, particularly what they’re not good at, and their development objectives. Try to base the work on that as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Create psychological safety and build trust by being open about your mistakes. Explain how you hope to improve things.</li>
  <li>UCD people work with well ambiguity; developers prefer clear cards.</li>
  <li>Get Show &amp; Tell lined up early, and sing people’s praises.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="being-agile">Being agile</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We need to know how big the problem is, it’ll help us work out when we’re done.</li>
  <li>Reach, impact, confidence, effort, and urgency are universal prioritisation criteria.</li>
  <li>Try not to rush cards through: take time to gather context and understand the problem holistically.</li>
  <li>Start small, test risky assumptions, iterate and grow.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-with-stakeholders">Working with stakeholders</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be open about how the team expects to achieve its objective. Be open about not yet knowing how to achieve that too.</li>
  <li>Don’t give senior stakeholders a problem, give them a solution or how you expect to move forward.</li>
  <li>Use senior people to twist arms when you need something from another party – you can’t do it all yourself.</li>
  <li>Present the risks and show your working to get buy-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do these resonate with you? What would you add or change? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser">Twitter</a>, it’d be great to hear from people.</p>

<p>It's a change in mindset for leadership to manage outcomes or results, instead of the traditional way of managing effort and output. Here's how I turn 'Build this' into 'Realise that' on GOV.UK at the UK's Government Digital Service.</p>
