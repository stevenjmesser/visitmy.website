Resolutions aren’t my style. Problems are only solved temporarily; you have to change tack. Adapt. 

But a few tweaks have been on my mind as we approach the new year: some new habits. Not too much. Just bettering things a bit. 

I’d like 2025 to be slow. Have deeper focus, some novelty, more memories. 

## Less scrolling, more reading

I’ve been scrolling mindlessly, distracted more than usual. I’m not too bad at it, but it has crept up. I want [time to notice and think more]({% post_url 2024-10-06-time-to-notice-and-think-more %}).

Changing habits will help. I’ll leave my phone by the stairs when I get in, get a new e-reader, and respect not bypassing screen-time limits. 

## Write daily

Like they taught us in my degree, set aside time for writing each day. It creates [more thoughts, more meaning]({% post_url 2023-03-15-sometimes-i-realise-ive-got-a-lot-more-to-say-than-i-thought %}).

Starting a daily journal will help, [writing notes as you go]({% post_url 2023-01-09-write-notes-as-you-go %}). I always forget the nice things when writing weeknotes, the little thoughts that pop up. This will help add a dribble of humanity too, make notes less workmanlike, dry, impersonal.

## Cook differently

Going to follow some new recipes instead of relying on learned dishes. Force creativity by bringing back constraints. What new dishes could be borne from only three ingredients? Or cooking in-season? Or using a new technique?

## Host a few more dinners

Managed three last year. Not bad. A couple more would be good. More smiles, more cheer. 

## Remember rules for drinking

[These simple rules]({% post_url 2024-06-19-rules-for-drinking %}) are easy to remember. The first rule has worked out well. Others less so, but that’s my fault, not the rules. Let’s try again.

## Maintain movement diligently 

Injuries hold me back from achieving my running goals. Those injuries can be countered by a bit more cross-training and sticking to strength & conditioning routines. Focus on glutes, core, and explosive movement.

## See people

Spent a bit too much energy on work, compared to last year. That’s natural given I’m freelance now, but I’ve seen fewer friends and family as a result. Going to reset that balance.
