Over a year ago, I took an unexpected step in my career: I became a freelance product manager.

Previously I’ve always worked in-house, as a permanent employee, but my time on the GOV.‌UK Design System went well. It made me consider whether I could continue as a contractor or freelancer. So I shared on LinkedIn that I’d be looking for a new contract in 2024.

People got in touch to talk about opportunities, and I’m humbled to have been asked to go in to organisations to show what good looks like.

So I’m taking a leap and starting a new venture, a company of one.

It’s called Boring Magic, based on a phrase that Conor conjured and [which I wrote about]({% post_url 2020-01-08-boring-magic %}). I pulled [the website](https://boringmagi.cc) together today, so it feels a bit more real. (And yes, it does have a novel domain name.)

It’s not perfect, there’s a few things to fix, but it’s a start.

Have a look and let me know what you think.
