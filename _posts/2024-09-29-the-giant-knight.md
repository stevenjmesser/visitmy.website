A child is walking down a residential street in Salisbury tapping out a military beat on a small drum. Behind him, four people push an assemblage of cardboard, fabric and a cabinet on casters that looks like a giant knight. It’s weird. It’s odd. I’m not sure what it’s about. It’s as if they’re the only float in a village fête. 

It’s one of the little absurdities in life, with no explanation, that adds some colour. It’s a delight.

Work was OK this week. I’d even venture to say it was a successful week. I got some good feedback from the team leads that the quarterly checkpoint felt more considered, like they had time to think through the upcoming months and get feedback from us on their plans.

It made me very happy to hear that. We’re working on an important project, the stakes are high and so are the tensions. But I’ve managed to create a space where they can feel in control and in which they’re empowered to make decisions, while also getting helpful feedback and nudges from leadership.

That’s been a good way to end a tough month. 

## Sounds

Since last week I’ve been listening to music a lot more. Usually I’d listen to a lot of music in a week, but this year I’ve not been taking notice of music much. But autumn’s here, winter is on the way, and there will be plenty of hours to while away in the dark evenings.

Sam Wilkes and Sam Gendel have been heavy on repeat in my ears. [‘I Wanna Be Loved’](https://samwilkes.bandcamp.com/track/i-wanna-be-loved) off _iiyo iiyo iiyo_ kicks off with some porch blues electric guitar then slides into jazz bits. [_Fresh Bread_](https://samgendel.bandcamp.com/album/fresh-bread) is a collection of instrumental and electronic experimental bits, all rather chilled and occasionally ambient. 

zuz invited me to [record.club](https://record.club/brokebroadbeat), so I’ll start using that. I wish [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/renegatus) still worked.

## Cronx Tech

Wednesday’s meet-up was fun. Thank you to everyone who came out. We only talked about Croydon for 13% of the evening and the number of MPs mentioned didn’t make it into double figures!

People were up for food so we’ll change the venue and make sure folks can grab dinner. [Fern](https://fernlondon.co.uk) seems like a good shout.

## Leadership course

I’m on the final module now, but the first two were the best. I don’t think I’ve learned anything new over the last three modules and some of the material has been questionable, even verging on being SAFe. But it’s been useful to think about my leadership style and what my product leadership framework might be.

## The next phase of my career

I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. 

I’ll probably carry on with tech and digital stuff for several years, but I’m feeling drawn back to where I started: food.

At some point I’d like to shift back to cheffing and creative pursuits. Wouldn’t it be fun to run a little restaurant? Plus it’d mean I could categorise eating out and drinking wine as ‘research’. 

There’s no doubt some hare-brained enterprises I could run between now and then too. I’m feeling like I’m more open to taking risks, anyway. Starting something. Investing in something. Giving it a go and being comfortable with at least trying if I don’t pull it off.

## Mixing it up

It’s been nice to read more blog posts this week, thoughts and notes on all sorts, not just work-stuff. Make sure you check out the bookmarks, some lovely bits in there.

Like [Neil](https://neilojwilliams.net/week-notes-23-29-september-2024/#:~:text=mix%20things%20up%20with%20other%20types%20of%20blog%20posts), I’ve been thinking about mixing it up recently. Getting back to writing notes about things that aren’t work. Work is too consuming. I’m blessed to work a job I’m passionate about and good at, but like my Dad says ‘Work is just a way to pay the bills’.

The drumbeat of weeknotes is a good spark plug, forcing me to stop and reflect. But I’m gonna have a crack at jotting thoughts down when they pop up. I had a good run of that in my [notes]({{ '/tag/notes' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} from last year.

## Back to the Giant Knight

I’ve just realised it’s [Phil from Time Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Harding_(archaeologist)) leading the knight down the street. AMAZING!
