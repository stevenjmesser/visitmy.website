A common feature of my weeknotes was to share some bookmarks – things I’d been reading that week. Since writing [my last weeknote]({% post_url 2021-07-03-the-last-weeknote %}), my reading (and writing) has declined, as I’ve been working very busily during the day and taking it easy the rest of the time. But now that I’m nearing autonomy in the day job, I’ll have a bit more time to read and write again.

Here’s some links and things that I’ve found interesting or helped me during the last 9 or 10 weeks. Customer satisfaction scores, designing forms and product career paths feature heavily.
