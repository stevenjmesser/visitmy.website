> Isn’t a miserable reality better than the most interesting illusion?

It’s a good question from _The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch_. Even if you could spend weeks off your box in outer space, you would need to return to reality eventually. Probably.

Better to have highs and lows than one constant, even if that constant is awe.

Time to read some more Philip K. Dick, I think.

Started reading _Valis_. This is from page 10:
