In the Before Times, I’d go to [Jam London](https://www.jamlondon.io/events/) religiously, every year. (Read my [notes from the 2019 event]({% post_url 2019-11-02-jam-2019 %}).) And once or twice a month, I’d pop along to a product/tech/design meetup somewhere. Those events were always fun and often taught me something, or at least got my brain going.

A global event changed all that, but this year I’ve been adamant about bringing that energy back into my life. I organised two public sector product unconferences and there’s another on the horizon.

I’ve been signing up for other events too. This morning I booked tickets to a web design conference and I’m delighted to see that [Ana](https://ohhelloana.blog) may be doing a talk! We’ve popped up in each other’s WebMentions and bookmarks, so it’ll be fun to hear what she’s got to say rather than reading her words.

Anyway, here’s a list of all the things I’m going to this year. Drop me a line on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@stevenjmesser)/[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/stevenjmesser.bsky.social)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser) if you’ll be at any of these, it’d be cool to say hi. And if there’s something I should be going to, let me know!
