Matt wrote about [hosting your website on a server in your bedroom](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/10/servers), about music playing or lights flashing when people visit your site, which is something I’ve been meaning to do for a while. It’s a super fun prospect.

The devs at GOV.UK harrumphed when I mentioned looking after a server: as you would when you’ve been at the sharp end of nginx timeouts and unauthorised access for a decade or two. But it’s an exciting concept for an amateur nerd like me.

Which reminds me of when folks at [Simpleweb](https://simpleweb.co.uk/) added a secret page to their site that allowed you to fire small Nerf darts at people in the office. And a site in the early 2000s when someone pointed a webcam at a CRT monitor you could send messages to. Most people sent rude messages. Or the time a family in south-east England (it was Kent or Essex; it was 2008, I can’t remember) dotted webcams around their kitchen and broadcast everything on justin.tv –￼ a neighbour found out and published their phone number online, so the household had to endure multiple phone-based pranks.

All right, I’ll hold my hands up. At least 6 pizzas have arrived at homes visible in the livestream of Abbey Road because of me. It was a waste and it was silly, but Domino’s system was very exploitable when it was all cash-on-delivery.

As much as I’d like to experience the murmurations of cyberghosts, is the idea of inviting cyberdemons just as fun? Based on the examples above, as soon as you introduce a webcam, the cyberdemons could come along.

Having said that, part of the fun is experiencing those cyberdemons. The merry pranksters with their hypertext fool-aid acid test.

You can only protect against so much. Buy the ticket, take the ride.

It’d be interesting to see how the proclivity to prank an internet-connected situation defines the generational divides of Internet natives.

Inviting cyberghosts into your home is a well-meaning pursuit to connect with other beings, albeit in a limited and one-directional way. Having grown up in the generation that followed, a lot of us wanted connection but we also played with exploiting the bounds of that (remember [the card stand thing](https://loosejoints.biz/products/card-stand)?). Now, you’ve got people making money from those connections on YouTube and Twitch, inviting their cyberghosts to become more real, to be in the room.

We all want connection online, and a good way to feel that is to bring the bits in the cloud closer. It’d be interesting to make that bi-directional. You can write in my guestbook and that will projected onto my bedroom wall, but in return I get to fire little foam darts off your mantelpiece while you’re watching telly.

The multiverse can wait. What about the interconnected playground we could build right here, in this universe?
