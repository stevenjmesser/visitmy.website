You never know who might be reading your weeknotes, or their experience with digital ways of working, so it’s nice to make your weeknotes educational. 

Although we strive to write with the human voice and make things understandable to a wide audience, you can open up your world and invite people in by explaining things and adding links.

One of our teams is working on design patterns for data. These patterns help us and other people design data specifications and standards more easily by following common patterns. For example, if we’re designing a data specification that includes dates, our [pattern for contextual dates](https://standards.planning-data.dev/patterns/contextual-dates/){:target="_blank"} tells us how to implement useable, trustworthy dates. 

Design patterns for data might be a new concept to some, but linking to [an explainer on design patterns](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-guidance/#toc-design-patterns-repeatable-solutions-for-common-design-problems-4){:target="_blank"} provides a little more context. To drive it home for the non-digital folk, we can show them how design patterns exist in everyday life – like the [boring magic of taps](https://public.digital/pd-insights/blog/2025/01/taps-and-the-case-of-boring-magic-in-design){:target="_blank"}. 

Making your weeknotes educational is one way to [cut windows in the sides of your silos](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/index.html#everyonecannowseethroughthesilos){:target="_blank"}. Let people peer inside. Help them learn and understand more.

Providing links and explaining why we’re doing something is [inclusive](https://createchange.io/how-not-to-radiate-intent/#:~:text=Don’t%20hide%20behind%20jargon.%20Be%20inclusive){:target="_blank"}. We should [fight the fog of work](https://www.gilzilberfeld.com/2017/09/visibility-the-fog-of-work.html){:target="_blank"}, make it thinner. 

The humility required to explain things simply and check for understanding, rather than showing off expertise or hiding behind terminology, is what [brings teams and communities together to solve hard problems](https://hbr.org/2019/05/cross-silo-leadership#:~:text=humble%20people%20are%20better%20at%20bringing%20others%20together%20to%20solve%20tough%20problems){:target="_blank"}.
