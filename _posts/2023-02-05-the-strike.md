An emptier week than usual due to the [civil service strike](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64241382) on Wednesday, which meant I had a day not working.

This week I

- investigated a couple of tools to help us see Kanban metrics for GitHub Projects
- kicked-off an investigation into progressive enhancement on our components and patterns
- had a great chat with our new comms & engagement folks
- joined a release party for [govuk-frontend v4.5.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.5.0)
- drafted a framework to help us decide which prioritised style, component or pattern to work on next
- ran a workshop to decide on next steps for the Exit this Page component, and
- caught up with one of our designers on the GOV.UK brand and what service teams might do about apps.

I’m having a restful weekend so won’t explore these in any great detail, but feel free to reach out if you want to chat about any of these in particular.
