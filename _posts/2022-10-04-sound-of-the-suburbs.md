From [Space and Sound: English Suburbia and The Streets](https://www.palatinate.org.uk/space-and-sound-english-suburbia-and-the-streets/):
> Paradoxically, Mike Skinner’s work reflects the realities of his suburban English experiences while serving as an escape.

I think that’s something Ian Hislop got wrong in his series, [In Suburbia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m0019z01?partner=uk.co.bbc&origin=share-mobile), when he said that critics don’t get excited about _sub_urban music (his emphasis). The Streets is the epitome of suburban music of the late 90s and early 2000s. The songs and lyrics capture what it means to live in the city, having left the suburbs. It’s a milestone in UK music.
