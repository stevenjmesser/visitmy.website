It’s a sunny morning in West Sussex. The birds are chirping and a bright, warm sun has melted a thick frost that formed overnight. It’s a small space, this caravan, this _roulotte_. But it’s toasty and roomy enough. 

I’ve come here for rest and recuperation, as mentioned [last week]({% post_url 2025-02-23-the-lump %}){:target="_blank"}. Somewhere different, a slower pace, a change of season. And the seasons will change soon, the daffodils on the table tell me that. The brighter evenings let you know. The sun’s getting higher in the sky.

Despite spending all week blindsided by a common cold, the week has ended with inspiration. Research by the Sea was one of the best conferences I’ve been to in yeeeeeears. So many [good, useful, inspiring, thoughtful, provocative talks](https://researchbythesea.com/schedule){:target="_blank"}. Much more about ethics and power and possibility than I’d expected. None of the ‘utopian bullshit’ you usually get at a product or digital conference, to quote one of the speakers!

Nicole Aleong’s workshop on applying futures orientations to UX research was fabulous too. It brought a nascent framework into life, and helped me realise that [I’ve done this sort of work before]({% post_url 2024-10-10-sketches-of-future-digital-services-in-government %}){:target="_blank"} only through intuition. Having this framework then might have helped us handle uncertainty better, but it’s a blessing to have it now.

These talks, these provocations came at the right time too. I’m thinking about what it is I want to do. My locus of my work is [the here and now](https://www.kubabartwicki.com/posts/designing-is-imagining/#:~:text=The%20here%20and%20now,-.%20You%20want%20the){:target="_blank"} plus [the soon after](https://www.kubabartwicki.com/posts/designing-is-imagining/#:~:text=The%20soon%20after,-.%20This%20is%20how){:target="_blank"}, but as a person I’m excited much more by [probable futures](https://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2024-2/vol-28-no-4-june-2024/some-aspects-of-futurism/#:~:text=probable%20futures){:target="_blank"}. Heck, it’d be nice if the soon-after were two-to-three years away rather than one or two quarters ahead.

So I need to figure out what to do. Perhaps I need to change my discipline. I use methods from various skillsets but people know me as a product person, which I think leaves you tied inherently to delivery. It doesn’t afford me as much space to play in the discovery space, to tease out and collect signals, to shape and mould those with others. 

Or does it? Maybe I’m just tying myself to the delivery end when there are others who can handle that. I can see and spot gaps in delivery and operations, but I can’t fix it all. 

I’ll continue to advocate that we [shift gear](https://www.kubabartwicki.com/posts/designing-is-imagining/#:~:text=I%20don’t%20think%20you%20should%20be%20working%20in%20a%20tight%2Dknit%20design%2Dtest%2Diterate%2Dbuild%20loop%20for%20an%20entire%20year.%20I%20don’t%20think%20you%20should%20be%20daydreaming%20for%20a%20full%20either%20year.%20A%20good%20team%20needs%20to%20recognise%20which%20to%20do%20when%2C%20and%20navigate%20between%20them%20constantly.){:target="_blank"}, slow down, take a step back and take stock. It’s a good time to do some [ecocycle planning](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/31-ecocycle-planning/){:target="_blank"}, employ creative destruction renew perspectives and refresh focus. A spring cleaning of the mind and our energy. 

Like Cennydd posited in [his talk](https://researchbythesea.com/cennydd-bowles){:target="_blank"} and like [Anna](https://annagoss.co){:target="_blank"} and I discussed over breakfast, it’s a time to be opinionated and redraw boundaries. To know when to say no, not always ‘Yes, and’.

That our methods to produce work aren’t enough to create a step-change or achieve the missions we’re set on. We need better narratives too, shared stories that hold us together. We need to engineer the vibes.

Prototypes like the ambient lamp and olfactory reminders aim to provide information and reminders without constant screen use. It’s encouraging people to engage with their environment, not another screen.

This has been written by US federal employees and digital practitioners facing DOGE’s dangerous dismantling of government technology. This is one of those boundaries we should establish now.
