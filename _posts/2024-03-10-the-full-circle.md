New job, new series of weeknotes.

For new readers, a weeknote is a diary-style recap of what I got up to at work during the week. The main purpose is to help me reflect on what I did and whether I achieved my goals, which helps me work out what to do next week. It‚Äôs also a record of what I did that I can look back on later.

There are [other reasons to write weeknotes]({% post_url 2020-11-01-why-i-write-weeknotes %}), and [lots of people in the public sector do it](https://neilojwilliams.net/about/week-notes/).

## What I did this week

I joined the [Digital Land team](https://digital-land.github.io/about/) at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) working on making land and housing data easier to find, use and trust. Right now, the team is working on [data standards](https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/) and a [data platform](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk) for the planning ecosystem.

Working in this space feels like coming home. Before joining Government Digital Service (GDS) in 2018, I was working at [Porism](https://porism.com) on open linked data for local government. I learned loads about open data and local government during my time there, but I was relatively new to all things digital and product management.

Now that I‚Äôve got more experience under my belt, I feel like I can make a decent contribution to [data as infrastructure](https://theodi.org/insights/explainers/what-is-data-infrastructure/). This project plays on some of my strengths: platform-thinking, making things open, and using technology to create economic value. So I‚Äôm super grateful to [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pdowney/), [Stef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanwebb/) and [Ann](https://annkempster.com) for bringing me in via [Boring Magic](https://boringmagi.cc). üôè

Anyway, that‚Äôs enough of that, what did I *actually* do this week?!

- Read the service handbook and got up-to-speed on the team, the platform and our ways of working
- Joined a workshop in the office to map our value stream and discuss opportunities to [unblock flow](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/beta-team/#slow-down-to-flow-fast)
- Had a couple of 1-to-1s with team leads and [Law](https://public.digital/people/lawrence-kitson)
- Tried adding RSS to the [team‚Äôs blog](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land.github.io/tree/main/content/blog-post), but realised I need to learn more about Jinja (and Python!)
- Did some reading and thinking about marketplaces on my day off
- Started shaping up the vision and a strategic narrative with Paul, ahead of a big planning workshop with the whole team next week

Throughout the week I was making lots of notes, jotting down any tasks, observations or opportunities that came up ([borrowed from Amy](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/new-job-process/)), which I was going to process and organise each evening. But I didn‚Äôt get around to that, so I need to do it today. The main opportunity I noted is that we need to create a roadmap as a team and highlight the milestones that‚Äôll impact us and other teams on the [programme](https://dluhcdigital.blog.gov.uk/category/digital-planning/). Not a roadmap as a plan, mind you, just a collaborative activity to talk about the road ahead and discuss challenges and opportunities.

And purely by chance, I topped off this data-heavy week by going out to dinner with data pal [Adam](https://adamlocker.github.io/my-wee-blog/), Head of Data Architecture and Engineering at National Highways. Perfect way to round off a homecoming!

## Other things

We‚Äôre running another unconference for product people in the public sector on [19 April in London](https://productforthepeople.xyz/product-for-the-people-4-london-d1d1cc92ebdc). Join us!

### Running

I‚Äôve missed several workouts in my marathon training plan due to injury, going hiking, and starting a new job. I‚Äôm trying not to beat myself up for it too much. This will be my second marathon and there‚Äôs still 10 weeks to go. Plus the northward equinox is nearly upon us, bringing with it earlier sunrises and longer days, meaning I can run in the morning rather than lunchtime.

Desperately need to start doing strength & conditioning exercises again though. My feet and ankles have been playing up, likely because I started wearing Nike Air Max 97s ‚Äì which have a significant heel drop compared to the zero-drop shoes I wear for running.

### IndieWeb

I really wish I‚Äôd gone to this weekend‚Äôs IndieWebCamp, especially because [Keith, Terence, Maggie and Ana were there](https://adactio.com/notes/20962) with [Paul](https://mastodon.social/@paulrobertlloyd/112067859754829665) (who I really, really want to meet!).

It would have been good to talk about the privacy of Webmentions and alternatives, which I‚Äôve read a bit about and been meaning to write about. I feel like the privacy concerns of those might be due to caching Webmentions, and building deletion requests into the protocol seems like a feasible feature. I‚Äôm not sure I like the alternative of using Mastodon as a replacement for Webmentions: it cuts out anyone who doesn‚Äôt use that platform, which doesn‚Äôt feel very Web-ish.

Anyway, like I said, it‚Äôs something I need to spend time thinking about in more detail.
