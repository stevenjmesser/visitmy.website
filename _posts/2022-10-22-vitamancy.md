Off the back of that post about [cyberghosts and cyberdemons]({% post_url 2022-10-12-cyberghosts-and-cyberdemons %}), I’ve been thinking about how to bring apparitions into my house when someone visits my website. My basic plan so far:

1.  When I’m at home, have a simple chat interface show for my website visitors
2.  Let the visitor send chat messages
3.  Have the messages scroll across an LED screen on a Pi Zero

It seems easy but maybe there’s a simpler setup. Scrolling text on a Pi Zero is easy, I’ve done that before. How the messages get from the visitor to the LED screen is the puzzle.

One to work on. Get in touch if you have any good ideas!

*Carrying on the idea of cyberghosts and cyberdemons, I toyed with calling it ‘ouija’ or ‘necromancy’, but the people sending messages are alive. So ‘vitamancy’.*
