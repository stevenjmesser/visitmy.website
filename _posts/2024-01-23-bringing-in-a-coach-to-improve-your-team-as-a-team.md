Last year we brought in a coach to help the GOV.‌UK Design System team make improvements – as a team, collectively.

Coaching and mentoring is one of the soft skills that product managers and delivery managers – at senior level and above – are expected to do. Just looking at [agile working](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/skills.html#agile-working) and [product ownership](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/skills.html#product-ownership) in the government’s digital skills framework, or do a quick search for ‘product manager coaching’.

But it can be hard to do alongside all that delivery work. And what if you could benefit from some coaching too?

Kelly, our senior delivery manager, has written up [our experience of bringing in a coach](https://medium.com/@kellyleeGDS/how-approaching-learning-and-development-as-a-team-can-improve-productivity-and-culture-d3df27e1c42f) and how it helped not only with productivity and quality, but how it also contributed to strengthening our culture.
