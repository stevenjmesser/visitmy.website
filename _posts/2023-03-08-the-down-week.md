Nothing much to share from last week. I was off sick for two days and did little of note at work:

- covered user support for a day
- iterated the survey for assessing WCAG 2.2’s impact on a service, and
- had plenty of one-to-ones.

Another thing I started looking into was our runway. There’s no profit motive in public service, but there is a need to deliver value for money for the taxpayer. The standard cost–benefit ratio is 2.4: if you’re creating 2.4 times as many benefits as it costs you to run, that’s a good thing. If we make a thing and it’s used by one team, they might as well have made it themselves. But given that we tend to focus on common problems, I’m expecting that we’re almost always delivering a better cost–benefit ratio.

It’s possible I returned to work too early though. Every evening I felt tired, and on Friday I was wiped. I did nothing on Saturday and felt better.
