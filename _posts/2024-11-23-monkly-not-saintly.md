One adverb we may hear used is ‘saintly’. It means someone or something holy, virtuous.

We never hear the word ‘monkly’. I’m not sure it exists. For me, it’s someone or something who commits to a particular discipline or devotion or craft. 

I daresay a lot of us would say that we _had_ devoted ourselves to our work, but it was always just a job. Which possibly diminishes the devotion we’ve given to the craft. 

As Bashō says: ‘No matter where your interest lies, you will not be able to accomplish anything unless you bring your deepest devotion to it.’ 

(But then I do get bored and distracted very easily. Ho hum.)
