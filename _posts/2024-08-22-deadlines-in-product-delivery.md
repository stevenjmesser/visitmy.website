Deadline is a dirty word, like [estimation]({% post_url 2023-09-13-estimating-software-projects %}).

There are few scenarios when they’re applicable, but it’s worth knowing when they’re essential. It’s usually when the strategic context requires it, like getting to market first or following a key event for users. [Deliverables help achieve outcomes for users](https://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2019/8/12/outcomes-goals-and-objectives), after all. A sandwich must be delivered to a deadline in order to achieve the outcome of a good lunch.

A deadline can set a healthy constraint for prioritisation or hammering scope too. This is most useful when it comes to a minimum viable product or feature set. It helps you think in iterations and get something smaller – but still valuable – out sooner.

It took me years to learn that. Working on coronavirus services helped, and launching an MVP at a startup compounded the learning.

So, they’re rarely necessary, but know when they’re useful. It’s a tool, not a sustainable way of working.
