Giles has written what looks to be the canonical resource for [doing weeknotes](https://doingweeknotes.com). It covers what weeknotes are, how weeknotes work, and how to start writing weeknotes of your own.

I love it. Whenever people ask me to tell them about weeknotes and how to get started, now I can just point them at this.

One of the things about weeknotes I’ve always loved is how their history is in blogging, as [Cory pointed out](https://boingboing.net/2018/07/25/deep-nerd-ruminations.html). But that’s a level of nerdiness that loads of people I work with don’t really care about.

It’s perfect that Giles has written this too. He shaped so much of how this is done in the public sector and inspired me enormously. Go check it out.
