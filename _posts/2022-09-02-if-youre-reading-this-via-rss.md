I woke up this morning and flicked through my RSS feed, which made me remember a fun thing I wrote at the start of the pandemic. That post was written after an early morning flicking through my RSS feed, so I thought I’d share it again.

You won’t find the post on my website, it lives only in the [commits on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenjmesser/visitmy.website/commit/edbb975c62abfda831677833ff7f49526d679c01#diff-f81c1c3a1a487a4b6e4a80f8b5a96c760e5cefbd24189a027c83724eb7beab97) (which isn’t easy to read) and the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200328103844/https://visitmy.website/2020/03/28/rss-massive/) (which is easy to read).

Hope you enjoy it.
