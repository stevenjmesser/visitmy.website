You might have noticed that this website looks a little plain today. But why?

I was looking at [Benjy Stanton’s website](https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/switching-to-eleventy-but-still-naked/) this morning as he’s ported it over to Eleventy, but I noticed that it was rather bare.

No styling anywhere. All Times New Roman and standard spacing. Using the browser’s defaults rather than his own stylesheets.

Then I spotted the link to [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io), a yearly event in which websites remove their CSS to show the semantic HTML.

> The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of HTML, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good old play on words. It's time to show off your <body> for what it really is.

I’m [a fan of Web Standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik9IeChLqEk), they make the Web [a great place for everyone](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#this-is-for-everyone), so I’ve removed all styling from my website for the day[^1].

[^1]: The styling is back now, but you can [see what the page looked like on the Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210409071423/https://visitmy.website/2021/04/09/lets-get-naked/).
