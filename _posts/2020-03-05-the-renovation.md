Reducing the amount of time I spend thinking about work outside of work is having its benefits, so I'm only gonna chat about 'personal things'. My mental health is improving by working on it. 

- _Parasite_ is a bit good, eh? The way Bong Joon Ho seamlessly stitched together different genres and moods throughout the story was masterful. After chatting to a friend who lived in South Korea for a while, I learned that it's a fairly common storytelling technique in their culture: extraordinary stories in common settings. I think that's why it worked so well. (I preferred [the NY Times review](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/parasite-review.html) to the Guardian's.)
- Went to see _1917_ the following week too, which is emotive and gut-wrenching and shocking all in one. People who've played _Call of Duty_ will get it immediately. Maybe avoid it if you're stressed out though, it'll have your veins pumped full of cortisol in no time. 
- The only other single-track film I've seen is [_Victoria_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4226388/), which I caught a trailer for a few years ago and saw on a whim. It turned out to be one of the best films I've ever seen, possibly knocking [_Pusher_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117407/) off the top spot. 
- If you're a GDS person, watch this documentary about [Spitalfields' decaying Georgian houses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00t3f42/ours-to-keep-incomers) and the 1980s effort to restore them.
- _Bass, Mids, Tops_ continues to deliver on providing me with new sounds to listen to. I've been enjoying Adrian Sherwood's repertoire and his [On-U Sound label](http://on-usound.com). Dubby, playful with music tech, celebratory of soundsystem culture. The [Doctor Pablo](https://onusound.bleepstores.com/artist/45578-doctor-pablo-the-dub-syndicate) stuff is cracking.
- As a result, there's a few dub tracks in my [February playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1In4kMSguQDCi7UVam8J88?si=Bh_MqGZHQ4mV3NfJFv151g&_php=1), alongside new British jazz supremo Moses Boyd, a new Legowelt, Ashley Henry and a fuzzy, blues number.
- I've been re-reading [_Lean UX_](http://leanuxbook.com) to give me a boost at work, and that's been really helpful. 
- Started the [designing strategy course](https://www.ideou.com/products/designing-strategy) from IDEO last week, it's so good. Not too dissimilar to Lean methods, to be honest, but I slightly different framework to suit any business context, not just digital products. Loving it so far. 
- Ordered [KRKs](http://www.krksys.com), which I've been meaning to do for like 12 years. Can't wait to hear tunes through those speakers!
- Thinking about the below quote from Andrew Weatherall, maybe weeknotes are good for sharing but not for active thinking.

> We live in a world where every minute is documented, so there’s not so much room to mythologise anything.[^1]

- Despite that, and in response to the quote below, I am going to say that the resurgence of rave culture is more about fashion than an actual backlash against the times we live in. 

> After years of fragmentation and polarisation, the joyful militancy of early rave feels poignant; the kind of unified response to political strife that this era is yet to produce.[^2]

- I'm going to redesign this website soon: get rid of the Javascript, make it accessible, learn Sass so that I can actually tweak the frontend. I'm using [Barber](https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll) as the theme currently but feel like making my own.
- Since we're on the cusp of an epidemic and I've got a bad cold, I'm isolating myself at home. Prevents other people catching it, but also tension and paranoia abounds on public transport. The slightest sniffle and people are alarmed.
