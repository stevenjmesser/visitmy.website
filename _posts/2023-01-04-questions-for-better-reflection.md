I write weeknotes to record what I’ve done, and to reflect on my practice as a product manager. I’ve used a couple of formats over the years, but the headings in my weeknotes template don’t provoke reflection. 

Though I do reflect by actively remembering and writing down what I did, I want to be more intentional with my weeknotes. A new set of questions should act as prompts, encouraging me to reflect on how my actions align with my values, or help me move towards the place I want to be spiritually.

## Personal values

After working at a startup and feeling like I wasn’t in the right place, that I wasn’t able to do work that fulfilled me, I made a move back to the public sector. At the time I told myself that working in public service aligns more closely with my personal values...but, to be honest, I didn’t _really_ know what those were.

Sure, I knew that I wanted to do things for people, not profit. And I knew that workplaces with good psychological safety energised me. But I couldn’t easily nail down my values. So I turned elsewhere for some help.

I read a few scholarly articles on personal values and there’s a popular framework developed by Shalom H. Schwartz that’s widely referenced. I found an online test that used the framework and answered its questions, to try and work out what my values might be.

My strongest felt values were

- hedonism
- universalism
- self-direction, and
- benevolence

Hedonism is about pleasure, enjoyment and having fun. Universalism is all about doing things for the benefit of other humans and nature. Self-direction is about creativity, freedom and choosing your own goals. Benevolence is about increasing the welfare of those around you.

## Coming up with the questions

I’ve written and edited a set of questions which, I hope, will help me reflect on whether I’m living my values. I’ve also included questions to help me think about how I’m finding balance, inspired by reading Becky Hall’s _The Art of Enough_.

If there’s no answer to one of these questions, it’s time to ask whether there was an opportunity to live that value in the week. Though I believe in growth, I also believe in limits and boundaries: you can’t push yourself endlessly, and we’re all subject to the chaos of the world. 

‘To the mind which lets go and moves with the flow of change, emptiness becomes a kind of ecstasy.’ This comes from Zen Buddhism, another influence on my thinking and doing in the last two years. In _The Way of Zen_, Alan Watts talks about relying on ‘peripheral vision’ or intuition, so I added a question about that too.

## My weekly prompts

The questions I’ve settled on as my weekly prompts are:

- What did I do for the people and planet?
- What did I appreciate? What was fun or made me happy?
- What did I do for those around me?
- What did I do for my well-being? What was ‘just enough’?
- What happened through play or intuition?
- What was hard or puzzling?
- What did I learn?

These questions will help me structure my reflections, pull the stories out of the work I did in the week, but they shouldn’t appear as headings in published weeknotes. I tried the headings in [S13E18]({% post_url 2023-01-06-the-chocolate-cake %}) but the weeknotes didn’t feel right, something I reflected on in [S14E01]({% post_url 2023-01-15-the-unconference-2 %}). 

I’ll continue experimenting with these prompts and tweak things where needed.
