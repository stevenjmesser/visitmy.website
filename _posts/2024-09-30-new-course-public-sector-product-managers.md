If you’re a new product manager in the public sector, or you’re curious about product management, there’s a new [Introduction to Product Management course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-product-management/2) on FutureLearn.

Way back in 2020, I contributed to the course and helped [bring it online](https://digitalpeople.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/06/building-the-introduction-to-product-management-course-online-and-remotely/) with people like [Arfah](https://arfahfarooq.com) and [Tobi](https://tobiogunsina.medium.com). And last year I helped iterate it with [Tom](https://www.leaningforward.com) and a couple others.

There used to be a video of me with bad pandemic hair in it, but they probably removed it. Tom made some great improvements and additions to the content.

[Check it out](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-product-management/2), it’s a nice introduction to the world of product. (It really is an introduction though, there’s not much working-level or intermediate stuff in here.)
