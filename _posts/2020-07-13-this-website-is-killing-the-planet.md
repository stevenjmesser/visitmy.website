For a while I‚Äôve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading [Gerry McGovern‚Äôs post on webwaste](https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/), I thought I‚Äôd procrastinated long enough.

So I ran a web page performance test and got some [grim results](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/): my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It‚Äôs just as bad [using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/). My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it‚Äôs eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.

But how much energy? I used the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com) to find out. It turns out that

- 6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage
- it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and
- it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km

Eugh. That‚Äôs disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.

I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I‚Äôm committing to some actions.

1.  I‚Äôll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that‚Äôs listed on the [Green Web Foundation‚Äôs directory](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/). ‚úÖ
2.  I‚Äôll compress and optimise the images on my site using [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac). ‚úÖ
3.  I‚Äôll get rid of [my energy-guzzling site theme](https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll) until I can introduce one that‚Äôs lightweight and accessible. ‚úÖ
4.  Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com). üìù
5.  I‚Äôll pay for some trees to be planted that‚Äôll reduce the impact of my website‚Äôs carbon footprint going forward. ‚úÖ [View the certificate üìú](https://treesforlife.org.uk/groves/249395/)

To show my commitment to being a good web citizen, I‚Äôll add the [Website Carbon Badge](https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/) to all pages ‚úÖ and the [Green Web Foundation‚Äôs renewable hosting badge](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/) ‚úÖ. Once I‚Äôve improved things, I‚Äôll add a [carbon.txt](https://carbontxt.org/) ‚úÖ.

One day I‚Äôll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I‚Äôm taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.

What‚Äôs the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?

It has been great to read everyone‚Äôs responses to this post, even those [questioning the merit of reducing carbon emissions on a personal website](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/no-your-clean-code-wont-save-the-planet/).
