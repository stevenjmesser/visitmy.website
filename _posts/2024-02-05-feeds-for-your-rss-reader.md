For ages now, I’ve been meaning to prune the feeds I’m following in my RSS reader. After encountering an issue with NetNewsWire on iOS, as a result of having too many unreads, I’ve gone through and reduced the list of subscriptions from 324 to 265 blogs, magazines and other web curios.

That’s still a ton of subscriptions but not every one is that active. I keep an eye out for new items from a bunch of people and places, but the rest are worth it for interesting tidbits that pop up on occasion.

Some feeds I stole from Matt Webb, another set were stolen from [Sidebar](https://sidebar.io), and the rest I’ve added myself. It’s full of digital government people, folks from the user-centred design and product worlds, plus galaxy brains from economics, politics, design and law. [There’s nee porn on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ojox3nLkBE).

You can download my [OPML file](https://visitmy.website/subscriptions.opml) and plonk it in your feed reader to get an injection of new RSS feeds to follow.

One day soon I’ll add a blogroll page. But that’s it for now.

Ciao.
