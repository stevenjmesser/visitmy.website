Back in February I [shared feeds for your RSS reader]({% post_url 2024-02-05-feeds-for-your-rss-reader %}), a heap of people and websites you can follow instead of scrolling social media all the time.

The only problem was that the list was pretty long. So I’ve pruned it into a [shorter, curated blogroll](/blogroll/). Take a look, you can download an OPML file to add to your RSS reader too. 

I’ve also added a `<link>` to the blogroll in the `<head>` of all pages, which is being picked up by this [blogroll network graph](http://alexsci.com/rss-blogroll-network/visualize/). Dave Winer [wrote about how to do it](https://opml.org/blogroll.opml#1710338479000), if you want to do the same.
