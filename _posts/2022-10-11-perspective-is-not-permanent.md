The other day, on Mental Health Awareness Day coincidentally, I had a wobble. Low mood clashed with bad news which lurched into a Sisyphean task at work. For a day and a bit I felt shit.

But after giving it time and talking to a few people, I could see a way through today. It didn’t all feel so desperate.

That’s what worked for me. Getting other perspectives. Changing my mind.
