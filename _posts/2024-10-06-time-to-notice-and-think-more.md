‘There’s just too much content.’ That thought has been on my mind recently.

Mostly I’m not vibing with short-form content. Social media. My consumption is low, limited to Bluesky, Mastodon and a bit of Reddit. But even that is too much.

The positive, optimistic posts are few. Although it’s lovely when they pop up, I’m not sure they’re worth a scroll through all the rest.

It’s autumn now, winter is around the corner, which will mean more time spent indoors. It feels like a good time to switch over to reading longer forms: more articles, more blog posts, more papers, and a return to reading books. (I’ve neglected books this year.)

I want to make more notes and develop my thoughts more too. More notes on food, wine, music. Still gonna have to do the same with work-related stuff, obvs, but I don’t want it to take up the majority of thinking space.
