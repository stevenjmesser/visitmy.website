For the first time in ages, I’ve woken up at 4 a.m. thinking about work. It’s hard to keep a track on my work without writing it down too, which means a return to weeknoting and journalling what I’m doing will help. 

But given I haven’t written any weeknotes since, ahem, late April, I’ve got a few months to catch up on. Loads happening, so these notes will be brief.

## Work things

- Changes to the cadence of how our whole team operates has gone well, and bringing more rigour to show & tells has helped with cross-team awareness and knowledge sharing.
- Leading the team coaching alongside our coach, [Stefan](https://www.stefanpowell.co.uk), has been fantastic, and it’s highlighting which team-forming workshops are a must (establishing ground rules, mapping roles and responsibilities across a value stream, working to a shared vision, etc.).
- The growth strategy I started working on is kicking off properly in October, as a discovery with our users. There’s not enough evidence to hand to validate assumptions with, and unlike other design systems we don’t have the closed boundary of a company to help set one strategy for all teams.
- That discovery will only look at opportunities for feature work, scaling work or extending product-market fit, though: the community strategy is at the heart of the GOV.‌UK Design System’s growth, and we’ve begun planning a small conference.
- Do you shape people’s experiences of using the web? Designers, developers, researchers, UXers, product managers, content folk, and other tech superstars of all shapes and sizes, come along to [Design System Day 2023](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-day/)! Better yet, answer our [call for speakers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/call-for-speakers-2023/) and tell the community a story of a cool component, pattern or design system you worked on.
- The early work Chris and I did on native apps became fruitful: we learned how the Digital Identity team crafted a component library and some guidelines for a GOV.‌UK-style app; we learned from HMRC everything they’d learned over the last 6 years about building an app; similarly we learned lessons from the NHS App team; and I put the person leading a cross-government app strategy in touch with teams working on apps (not part of my contract, but something worth doing).
- The GOV.‌UK Frontend squad is close to getting [v5.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/milestone/46) out the door as a pre-release, a chance to collect feedback before a full public release in Q3.
- The Design System squad launched [Exit this Page](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2023/08/14/exit-this-page-fast-with-the-design-systems-new-component/) and has been beavering away to [make our components and patterns compliant with the new WCAG 2.2 guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/46?pane=issue&itemId=15258274).
- The work includes an epic I ‘commissioned’ to [re-design how we write and publish accessibility content](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/46?pane=issue&itemId=15258274), which ~85% of our users say is the biggest benefit they get from the GOV.‌UK Design System (but there are improvements to be made).
- We’ve [updated the team playbook a few times](https://github.com/alphagov/design-system-team-docs/commits/main) but need to focus on defining and writing the low-hanging fruit.
- I’m still very interested in [shaping and working on big bets]({% post_url 2022-11-09-a-team-for-thinking-big-and-starting-small %}) and getting more agency-type experience, so hit me up if you think there’s something I could work on from February 2024 onwards (when my contract at Government Digital Service is due to end).
- There’s a few blog posts sitting in my drafts folder that need to be published, and I’d like to write one on delivery pacing (vary the intensity consciously).

## Not-work things

- Ultramarathon training has shifted to marathon training, as I was trying to do too much too soon. The 80/20 plan is fantastic though, making high weekly mileage but sustainable.
- Low-alcohol life is going well! Granted I took a week off in July to enjoy wine in Croatia, the reason for visiting, but I have developed a new relationship to booze – I’ll write about that.
- I haven’t been fastpacking or camping since April, must get a trip in the diary before summer is out.
- My family treated me to a pizza oven for my birthday and, you know what, I don’t think I’ll need to spend £14 on a Napoli-style pizza ever again.
- Went to my first Eisteddfod and had a _cracking_ time.
