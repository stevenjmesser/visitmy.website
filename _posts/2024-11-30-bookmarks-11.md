Bookmarks usually appear at the end of [my weeknotes]({{ "/tag/weeknotes" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}, but I spent most of November travelling around Japan. I like to share these [bookmarks]({{ "/tag/bookmarks" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} anyway, as a dated archive for myself but also for anyone else who might find the links interesting. 

(I used to share an annual round-up – or reading list – but [I failed to do that last year]({% post_url 2023-12-23-the-long-now %}){:target="_blank"}. I’ll bring it back this year!)

There’s a whole bunch of stuff in there on various different topics. I’ve added a summary for each bookmark too, so you’ve got more than a title to help you decide whether to read it or not. 

For [robot voice transparency](https://ia.net/topics/writing-with-ai#5){:target="_blank"}: if the summary wasn’t provided by the original author or publication, Ghostreader’s [auto-summarisation](https://docs.readwise.io/reader/docs/faqs/ghostreader){:target="_blank"} helped me write it. I’ve adapted what it spat out. I’m working towards a different reading and note-taking system though, so these will be Steve-generated in future.

Good for shifting your personal use of AI to renewable energy sources. The added interaction cost could counteract Jevon’s paradox.

- **[Box114: I suppose it’s a gift. But not a good one.](https://blog.tobiasrevell.com/2024/10/30/box101-i-suppose-its-a-gift-but-not-a-good-one/){:target="_blank"}, 15 mins.** Tobias talking about how he uses speculative design (and creative writing, IMO) to explore futures.

- **[The meaing of “AI”](https://adactio.com/journal/21552){:target="_blank"}, 3 mins.** The term “AI” is confusing because it has different meanings in science fiction and in current technology, like large language models. This confusion can lead people to focus on unrealistic sci-fi dangers instead of real issues, such as exploitation in tech. Using a clearer term, like “applied statistics” would help avoid this misunderstanding. 💅
