Search sucks these days. Social media is getting sucky too. RSS is excellent but how do you find new people, except inside links shared by others?

Just came across [about ideas now](https://aboutideasnow.com) which means you can search across the `/about`, `/ideas` and `/now` pages of over 7,500 personal websites! It’s so cool. It’s kind of like [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory) or [Kagi Small Web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) but through a more limited lens. I love it!
