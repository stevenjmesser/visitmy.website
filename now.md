<p>Right now I'm
  <ul>
    <li>working on the GOV.UK Design System</li>
    <li>reading <i>The Goods of Design</i> by Ariel Guersenzvaig, <i>Acceptance</i> by Jeff VanderMeer and <i>Company of One</i> by Paul Jarvis</li>
    <li>learning driving theory again</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Later I'd like to
  <ul>
    <li>learn about CSS grid systems</li>
    <li>update my website with a new theme</li>
    <li>add a portfolio of product work to my website</li>
    <li>research the similarities between digital strategy and guerrilla warfare</li>
    <li>pick up where I left off learning Welsh</li>
    <li>walk the Ll≈∑n Peninsula section of the Wales Coast Path</li>
    <li>finish walking the South Downs Way</li>
    <li>take and pass my driving test</li>
    <li>sketch out a redesign for this website on Figma</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>If I finish the projects in the top list, I'll have time to take on projects in the bottom list. That, I'm told, is the point of a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>.</p>
