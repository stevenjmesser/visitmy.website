Hello!

I’m Steve. For the day job I’m a product strategist and I’m working on making land and housing data easier to find, use and trust. But here’s some other [things I’m doing now]({{ "/now" | relative_url }}).

You might be interested to read what I’ve written about [product management]({{ "/tag/product-management" | relative_url }}). Often I’ll write weeknotes about my work and my personal life. You can read my [weeknotes]({{ "/tag/weeknotes" | relative_url }}), or check out [other topics I write about]({{ "/topics" | relative_url }}).

If you want to know a little more about my background, [read about me]({{ "/about" | relative_url }}) or [check out my portfolio]({{ "/work" | relative_url }}).
