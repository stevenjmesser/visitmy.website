    <p>A bit late getting these out, it was a busy weekend so I didn’t have time to write my weeknotes. A decent week but, given that we’re halfway through the quarter, it feels like I’m running out of time to write a white paper on personalisation. That shouldn’t feel the case. It’s not possible to explore ideas fully within a deadline; it’ll end when it ends.</p>

<h2 id="five-things-that-happened">Five Things That Happened</h2>

<p><em>We did more things than this</em></p>

<h3 id="one">One</h3>

<p>Met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/Martin_Jordan">Martin</a>, Head of Service Design, to chat about life events and what’s going on in digital government internationally. He hooked us up with some useful people in Germany and Estonia, and I shared some work Porism did on <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/list/lifeEvents">life events</a> and <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/list/circumstances">circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>I also chatted with Christina, a user researcher at DfE but previously working at HMRC, about work she’d been involved in called ‘credential alignment’. Some research participants expressed frustration that there wasn’t a link between HMRC services and Companies House services, and it’s possible there’s more gaps like that across government.</p>

<h3 id="two">Two</h3>

<p>I started writing a talk for the GDS product management community meet-up about blogging and working in the open. The aim is to encourage more product managers at GDS to blog about their work, either on the official blogs or elsewhere, but I spent all the time talking about the idea behind working in the open. So I’m not sure how that’s going to inspire people. It probably sucks.</p>

<p>Please do let me know if you’d be happy to take a look.</p>

<h3 id="three">Three</h3>

<p>My team-mates on Search Resilience &amp; Performance got the new <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/search-api">search-api</a> working in Integration, including queries for other applications, really quickly. They had to switch back to <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/rummager">rummager</a> briefly for some priortised testing but it didn’t disrupt them too much. They spent the time working out how to create a ‘super schema’ for document type mapping, which should mean that upgrading from Elasticsearch v5.6 to v6 will be a one-click upgrade. This will also give the new application time to bed down, exposing any issues we might miss by pressing on too quickly.</p>

<p>They also explored using machines with different specifications for the master nodes and data nodes. It’s actually cheaper doing it that way, which is nice, so it’ll save tax-payers more money in the long-run – which is great. Next we’re testing different sharding options to optimise the latency and resilience of the clusters.</p>

<h3 id="four">Four</h3>

<p>Spent lots of time writing and practising a presentation about our work on GOV.UK for the <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180801140850/https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/digital/digital-centre-of-excellence/">Digital Centre of Expertise</a>, a meeting of digital marketing and communications professionals from across government. Because I’m in the early stages of exploring something – what I’m calling a strategic discovery – I spent my 5 minutes talking about generative research and innovating on evidenced user needs.</p>

<p>It’s a bit vague about what we’ve been doing, really, but that’s the point: I don’t want anyone to think we’re committing to any technical solutions before we’ve found a problem to solve. Whilst I’m arguably in the business of innovation (small ‘i’), it’s not my style to indulge in Innovation theatre (big ‘i’). Dave Rogers wrote a timely post about <a href="https://medium.com/@daverog/why-hype-technology-is-killing-innovation-84151c62a18b">why hype technology is killing innovation</a> and got the message across much better than I could, I strongly recommend everyone read it.</p>

<p>For the presentation’s final revision, I came across this part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy">Government Transformation Strategy</a> (my highlighting):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will transform government services and make government itself a digital organisation so that citizens, businesses and other users have <strong>a better, more coherent experience</strong> when interacting with government services - one that meets <strong>the raised expectations set by the many other (non-government) services and tools they use every day</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It made me feel better about what we were exploring, so I went big on selling that vision not the specific technology. It has made it easier to sleep at night and consider how we might frame any eventual user research.</p>

<h3 id="five">Five</h3>

<p>I wrote a post about <a href="https://visitmy.website/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/">how we use OKRs</a> and syndicated <a href="https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/how-we-use-okrs-on-gov-uk-1a8ac8be7eba">the content on Medium</a>. It has been doing well on Medium with over 1,000 views since I posted it, but only 11 per cent of traffic has come from Medium itself. The rest has come from a couple of tweets (by others, not me) and posts on news boards (by me).</p>

<p>For me, it’s proven the worth of leaving Medium to <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1099056242306236417">make the web personal again</a>, driving value to your blog not Medium’s platform. To that end, the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611805/the-four-ways-that-ex-internet-idealists-explain-where-it-all-went-wrong/">Internet idealist</a> in me added a link to my blog’s RSS feed in the top navigation bar.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h3>

<p>That some times you need to wield the vision to carry things forward.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-could-do-better">What I Could Do Better</h3>

<p>I had some strong phrases edited out of my presentation, so I could probably do with learning a bit of diplomacy.</p>
