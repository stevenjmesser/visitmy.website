In simple terms, it’s a bit like tweets without Twitter. But depsite getting off to a good start, RSS has all but disappeared as people have moved to centralised silos like Twitter. The reason? Too many competing standards.

Instead we should be data-informed, reading metrics and measures to inform our decisions. But it’s worth remembering that data is never raw: the schema by which you collect and read data goes some way to defining how you’ll interpret it.

The late neurologist Oliver Sacks writes about the disappearence of old civilities, where people have replaced talking to their neighbours with talking to their phones. But there’s hope in this piece too, that people will realise the need to sustain the richness of human cultures. And since more of us are putting our phones down, I’m hopeful too.\n\nRead The Machine Stops.\n\nThe attention economy\n\nOwen Williams puts forward the idea that most products are competing for the space in front of your eyeballs. Attention is now a commodity as much as technology, and the only limit is the population and the number of waking hours.\n\nRead The attention economy.\n\nThe Case for Doing Nothing\n\nNiksen is the Dutch concept of embracing boredom to stop ourselves being so busy. It’s a bit like mindfulness, only you don’t need to pay Headspace a subscription fee to learn how to do it. This piece makes the case for doing nothing with purpose.\n\nRead The Case for Doing Nothing.\n\nThe Web and data\n\n30 years on, what’s next #ForTheWeb?\n\nThe World Wide Web is 30 years old, so I couldn’t not include this. Since you’re using the Web, please read it!\n\nRead 30 years on, what’s next #ForTheWeb?.\n\nThe Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement\n\nFollowing on from the piece by Lowtech magazine in last year’s picks, this piece by Becca Abbe talks about moving off-grid in a digital sense: opting out of mainstream internet providers and building independent mesh networks or a peer-to-peer Web. Whatever the solution, making things more sustainable is a critical consideration for the next few decades.\n\nRead The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement.\n\nThe Rise and Demise of RSS\n\nRSS is one of those wonderful Web technologies, meaning you can follow updates from anyone across the world. In simple terms, it’s a bit like tweets without Twitter. But depsite getting off to a good start, RSS has all but disappeared as people have moved to centralised silos like Twitter. The reason? Too many competing standards. The story of RSS teaches us that a better, more open Web will come from getting better at working together.\n\nRead The Rise and Demise of RSS.\n\nThe Semantic Web identity crisis: in search of the trivialities that never were\n\nIn a similar vein to the story of RSS, Ruben Verborgh talks about the last two decades of research into the Semantic Web – and how it hasn’t really changed the world much. The dream was big, the vision was crystal clear, but through lack of dogfooding the dream hasn’t been delivered. But if semantic technologies can be brough out of the research space and into the world of product development…who knows?\n\nRead The Semantic Web identity crisis: in search of the trivialities that never were.\n\nWhy Data Is Never Raw\n\nI don’t believe we should aim for data-driven futures because it renders human decisions as useless. Instead we should be data-informed, reading metrics and measures to inform our decisions. But it’s worth remembering that data is never raw: the schema by which you collect and read data goes some way to defining how you’ll interpret it. In The New Atlantis, Nick Barrowman talks about the seductive myth of information free of human judgment.\n\nRead Why Data Is Never Raw.\n\nUnicorns, Ontologies and How the Mind Organizes the World\n\nThe world of structured data was a right headf**k when I first joined Porism. Since there’s much chatter about ontologies, taxonomies, registers and other aspects of semantic technologies at work now, I always send this article to anyone starting out. Who knew a story about Marco Polo would help frame it so well?!\n\nRead Unicorns, Ontologies and How the Mind Organizes the World.\n\nJust good stories\n\n“We’re not leaving this bar until we’ve come up with such a great idea that I can’t sack you”\n\nThe story of how BBC iPlayer came about because of a drunken brainstorm as told by Tony Ageh, who was the project director for the thing. It’s funny and uplifting and wonderfully down-to-earth.\n\nRead “We’re not leaving this bar until we’ve come up with such a great idea that I can’t sack you”.\n\nHow William Gibson Keeps His Science Fiction Real\n\nWilliam Gibson invented the word ‘cyberspace’ and, along with it, the cyberpunk movement and everything that inspired. I grew up on The Matrix, Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic and the video game Deus Ex, so it’s pleasing to hear how the books that inspired those worlds – beginning with Gibson’s debut Neuromancer – came together.\n\nRead How William Gibson Keeps His Science Fiction Real.\n\n“It wasn’t all about drugs”\n\nBy talking to teenagers about the acid house movement of the 1980s, Jeremy Deller managed to explore the period and what it was really all about, without falling on the obvious answer of drugs. This is a good interview about his documentary, Everybody in the Place: an Incomplete History of Britain 1984–92, but you should definitely also watch the doc.\n\nRead “It wasn’t all about drugs”.\n\nThe Brexit Warnings to Be Found in Sheep Grazing in a London Park\n\nAn overlapping of stories about the commons, Boudica, Hampstead Heath, and thoughts on Brexit back in September. (I mostly like it for the agricultural experiment and the archeology, but there’s something in there for politicos too.)\n\nRead The Brexit Warnings to Be Found in Sheep Grazing in a London Park.\n\nThe real-life Ali G\n\nCan’t remember why I came across this story about Tim Westwood but it’s absolutely cracking.\n\nRead The real-life Ali G.\n\nIn 1968, computers got personal\n\nThe story of how ‘the mother of all demos’ changed the world, moving computing from the research space to the commercial space. By helping people imagine a future in which everyone had a computer, we now do.\n\nRead In 1968, computers got personal.\n\n\n \n \n If anyone has stratified the eras of government transformation, digital and beyond, please do let me know! &#8617;\n \n \n\n", "datePublished": "2019-12-14 00:00:00 +0000", "dateModified": "2019-12-14 00:00:00 +0000", "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Steve Messer" }, "publisher": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Steve Messer", "url": "https://visitmy.website", "logo": { "@type": "ImageObject", "width": 32, "height": 32, "url": "https://visitmy.website/icon/favicon.ico" } }, "mainEntityOfPage": { "@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://visitmy.website/2019/12/14/reading-list-picks-of-2019/" }, "image": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://visitmy.website/assets/images/tumblr_mqr0hcRxQy1qftageo1_1280.png" } } </script></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__tags"><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/weeknotes">Weeknotes</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/blogroll">Blogroll</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/product-management">Product Management</a></li><li><a class="footer__link" href="/tag/agile-delivery">Agile Delivery</a></li></ul><div class="footer__social"><script type='text/javascript' src='https://ko-fi.com/widgets/widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support Me on Ko-fi', '#000000', 'O4O6QOB4');kofiwidget2.draw();</script></div><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser" target="_blank" rel="me"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenjmesser/" target="_blank" rel="me"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/stevenjmesser" target="_blank" rel="me"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><section class="contact popup"><div class="popup__close"><div class="popup__exit"></div></div><div class="contact__container popup__container"><div class="contact__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url(/assets/images/seo.jpg);"></figure></div><div class="contact__content"><div class="contact__mast section-padding--half"><div class="grid"><h2>Contact</h2></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><hr class="sep"/></div><div class="contact__form section-padding--half"><div class="grid-xlarge"> <form id="form" class="form" action="" method="POST"><div class="form__subcontainer"><div> <label for="form-first-name">First Name</label> <input type="text" name="first-name" id="form-first-name" required></div><div> <label for="form-last-name">Last Name</label> <input type="text" name="last-name" id="form-last-name" required></div></div><div> <label for="form-email">E-Mail</label> <input type="email" name="email" id="form-email" required></div><div> <label for="form-message">Message</label> <textarea name="message" id="form-message" rows="3"></textarea></div><div class="form__submit"><div class="form__btn"> <input type="submit" value="Send"></div></div><p class="form__message"></p></form></div></div></div></div></section><script src="/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
