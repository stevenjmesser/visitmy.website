    <p>Weeknoting is a reflective practice, like writing a diary for your work life, but I havenâ€™t written weeknotes over this quarter. Not for ten whole weeks. It has been my first major break and now Iâ€™m missing the space it affords me to mentally process and package everything thatâ€™s going on. Because thereâ€™s a lot going on and, quite frankly, Iâ€™m feeling really tired. I need a break, so hopefully this wee missive will help me reflect and move on to the next things.</p>

<p>Over the last ten weeks Iâ€™ve been running the Search &amp; Navigation team (of fourteen people), contributing to GOV.UKâ€™s 2019/20 roadmap, thinking about and helping shape GOV.UKâ€™s future strategy, and trying to keep up with the worlds of tech and data. It is the hardest I have ever worked in an office job and the most I have stretched my management skills. It has been mentally draining, but very much worth it. I just havenâ€™t had the spare capacity to write about work after switching off from it.</p>

<p>Next quarter Iâ€™d like to get back into the habit.</p>

<h2 id="things-that-happened">Things That Happened</h2>

<p><em>We did more things than this</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Learned about <a href="https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust">data trusts</a> thanks to the Open Data Institute and some clever people they asked to think about the concept</li>
  <li>Downloaded into my brain all previous user research and the history behind site search on GOV.UK</li>
  <li>Worked with a team of performance analysts and a data scientist to identify where site search needs to be improved</li>
  <li>Worked with our developers to pay down a massive slab of tech debt and design how we might perform multivariate testing on dynamic pages</li>
  <li>Presented our work exploring personalisation in government to the <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/12/11/growing-the-international-design-in-government-community/">international Design in Government community</a>, the heads of strategy and innovation at GDS, other product people on GOV.UK, and people who worked on similar projects before</li>
  <li>Met with some lovely people at Citizens Advice and am excited about collaborating more with <a href="https://twitter.com/kyliehavelock">Kylie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Na7hanGood">Nathan</a></li>
  <li>Made a mistake in people management but was blessed to be able to learn from open criticism and feedback</li>
  <li>Was involved in eight workshops that defined the vision and future strategy for GOV.UK, thinking beyond a website to being a key component in government product experiences</li>
  <li>Spent time thinking about and helping put in place measures for how a 14-person team might release valuable features, at pace, without breaking other peopleâ€™s stuff</li>
  <li>Set a product vision to make site search work smarter for users (and teach us where users expect GOV.UK to be more intelligent)</li>
  <li>Learned from <a href="https://twitter.com/mattinwales">Matt</a> how to be an excellent lead assessor at service assessments (and was called â€˜Mr OKRsâ€™ by him)</li>
  <li>Set and met some OKRs with the team</li>
  <li>Neutered a complicated (and, frankly, genius) distributed domain ranking exploit by a porn tube site</li>
  <li>Had dinner with a product management idol, <a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish">John Cutler</a></li>
  <li>Had dinner with some <a href="https://twitter.com/dasbarrett/status/1136032260564684800">UK data legends</a></li>
  <li>Heard super clever people talk at <a href="https://attending.io/events/citizen-beta-summer-gathering-and-talks">Citizen Beta</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Service-Lab-London/events/261829958/">Service Lab</a></li>
  <li>Gave up booze for 14 days</li>
  <li>Read a 500-page sci-fi novel</li>
  <li>Delighted in watching us make GOV.UK more understandable to machines with <a href="https://govuk-publishing-components.herokuapp.com/component-guide/machine_readable_metadata">metadata</a></li>
  <li>Learned how search engines actually work, thanks to the World Wide Webâ€™s beauty in being a repository of knowledge and information â€“ and some nice people at Ecosia and DuckDuckGo were kind enough to chat</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a lot of things. Iâ€™m very lucky to have this job. Itâ€™s good to remember that when my energy is low.</p>
