    <p>Headlines only for last week because it’s a busy time and things are moving fast.</p>

<h2 id="five-things-that-happened">Five Things That Happened</h2>

<p><em>We did more things than this</em></p>

<h3 id="one">One</h3>

<p>We had a visit from a couple of very important people under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/boris-johnson">the new leadership</a> of the current government. I’m not sure I’m allowed to name them (I’ll check, in the spirit of being open) but I was glad to have attended a public speaking bootcamp a few weeks ago. The skills I learned worked well.</p>

<p>_Edit: No, I’m not. Not now, anyway.</p>

<h3 id="two">Two</h3>

<p>I met with <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno/">Mark Dalgarno</a> to talk about how product teams can manage upwards, helping the more senior layers of management devise a strategy for achieving an organisation’s outcomes. He’s a damn clever bloke and good company to boot.</p>

<p>Later in the week I chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/AliceNoakes">Alice Noakes</a> about the same subject and it sounds like she’s basically been an internal management consultant at the Care Quality Commission. A tough brief but she’s approached it with tenacity. She’s a bloody good product manager though, so you’d expect that.</p>

<p>If anyone else would like to talk about managing upwards, drop me a line. I suspect there’s more stories out there. (I’m lucky that I don’t need to manage upwards, but it’s worthwhile learning how just in case.)</p>

<h3 id="three">Three</h3>

<p>I formed a new team for Brexit-y business – and unfortunately had to put Permissions to bed for a bit – and spent three days blasting through the Nebula of Unknown to arrive at a minimum viable product (MVP). I’m grateful for having a strong technical lead in Kevin and I’ve been lucky enough to work alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/annagoss">Anna</a>, who’s a bloody great service designer and product manager.</p>

<p>Figuring out all the possibilities and technical complications to arrive at what’s most readily valuable, usable, feasible and viable is draining.</p>

<h3 id="four">Four</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/blangry">Alex</a> asked me if his approach to product-managing something was sound. It was, of course. A man of his capabilities needn’t ask a kid like me!</p>

<h3 id="five">Five</h3>

<p>Oh yeah, and some of the statistics community got annoyed by some changes that we made to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics">Research &amp; Statistics finder</a>. It’s something I inherited from another product manager and so I trusted that they’d covered all the bases, but it turned out they hadn’t. Regardless, we’ve had a feedback survey running on the new finder since 4 June – it’s just no one got in touch to say there were features missing. Ffuuuuuuuu—</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s all sorted now. We also had to switch the A/B test to 100:0 for Elasticsearch 5 vs Elasticseach 6. That’s because the new content similarity algorithm, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">BM25</a>, was throwing up some weird results and publishers were getting antsy, what with Brexit on the way. It was fine to switch back though, we’ve collected a week’s worth of clicks performance data for analysis.</p>

<p>The team are working on optimising the queries relative to BM25 now. Michael’s had a <a href="https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk/weeknotes-048.html">clever idea</a>. I miss the team.</p>
